{"_id": 25, "text": "(Reuters) - Ajax Amsterdam captain Siem de Jong and striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson will miss Dutch league action again this weekend and are in doubt for next Wednesday's vital Champions League match at AC Milan .De Jong has a hamstring injury, picked up on international duty with the Netherlands last month, and is out of Saturday's home game against NAC Breda . Iceland international Sigthorsson has returned to training after an ankle injury but worked apart from the rest of the first team on Wednesday, Ajax said on their website. Ajax will be keen to get both back to bolster their chances in their final Champions League Group H match at the San Siro, which they must win to qualify for the knockout phase. Barcelona, top of the group with 10 points, are already through, but Milan, second on eight points, and Ajax, on seven, will fight it out for the second qualifying spot. Celtic have been eliminated on three points from five matches. Ajax were boosted last weekend by the return from injury of Bojan Krkic, the forward on loan from Barcelona . He scored in their win over ADO Den Haag on Sunday, a game missed by both De Jong and Sigthorsson. Ajax are second in the Dutch league, two points behind leaders Vitesse Arnhem .\n"}
{"_id": 25, "text": "LONDON \u2014 One of the main attractions that drew Megan Rapinoe to Lyon earlier this year was the club's complete and utter dominance. Lyon had won two straight European championships, shredded all comers in the French league by N.F.L.-like scores and was often referred to as the female game's equivalent to Barcelona . In many ways, that comparison was an understatement.Rapinoe, 27, a star midfielder for the United States women's soccer team, fit in well with Lyon : she scored four goals in 15 games for the club, including one each in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds of the Champions League as Lyon outscored its opponents by a combined. Given that continued success, most observers assumed Lyon would produce a similar result here in the final.But on Thursday at Stamford Bridge, Rapinoe saw it all suddenly, and stunningly, slip away for Lyon . After an inconsistent first half from the entire team, Rapinoe was taken out at halftime and had to watch from the bench as Martina Muller converted a 73rd-minute penalty kick, which proved the difference in Wolfsburg's 1-0 victory. Lyon, which had scored 223 goals and allowed 10 in its previous 36 games, was punchless at the worst time.When it was over, Rapinoe sat on the bench for a moment, staring at the field. She then walked out and shook hands with several Wolfsburg players before hugging a few of her teammates who were slumped over on the field. Rapinoe, who was hoping to become the third American woman to win a Champions League final, was not injured and said afterward that she had not expected to be removed by Lyon's coach, Patrice Lair.\"I didn't think I should have come off, but that's the coach's decision,\" she said. \"I haven't always played 90 minutes, but I've usually played more than.\"Rapinoe generally plays more on the wing for Lyon than she does with the United States team, and she did not have many touches in the first half on Thursday. She did swing in a corner kick that Amandine Henry headed just wide, and she also nearly scored on a header of her own that was cleared off the goal line . Those chances, however, were emblematic of Lyon's larger issue: its typically prolific offense simply could not find a way through.The defeat was Lyon's first regulation loss in 120 matches, a streak that began before Lair even arrived at the club.\"I think everyone was shocked,\" Rapinoe said of the sentiment in Lyon's locker room after the game. \"It's an unusual feeling.\"Despite the frustration over having her night cut short, Rapinoe said the experience did not sour her feelings about returning to Lyon . The team still has the French Cup final to play, and Rapinoe expects to rejoin the United States team in time for two exhibition matches against South Korea in mid-June . She is then planning to play with the Seattle franchise in the new women's professional league and finish the season there.Rapinoe said that she believed Lyon was interested in re-signing her and that this season had left her wanting to return for a second season in France. The salaries for players there are superior to what players can make elsewhere (she makes roughly,000 euros, or about,000, a month, and she has enjoyed immersing herself in a foreign culture. Her French has improved, and she has grown more comfortable in Lyon, where she rents a two-bedroom apartment and has sampled restaurants, museums and the famous opera house . Late Thursday, as her teammates headed to the team bus, she also pointed out that she had a measure of unfinished business now. While giving plenty of credit to Wolfsburg, which won in the club's first appearance in the European final, Rapinoe said it was difficult for many of the Lyon players to see Wolfsburg lift the trophy \"that we thought we could have won.\"She also noted, with a bit of a sigh, her own track record in significant games. She has now appeared in a World Cup final and an Olympic gold-medal game with the United States, as well as the Champions League final . Only at the Olympics was she on the winning side.\"I've played in three big finals, and I've lost two,\" she said. \"That's not the kind of results I'm looking for.\"\n"}

World Cup hosts Brazil will attempt to keep the momentum going after their Confederations Cup win in June as they visit Switzerland in another of the nearly 50 friendlies being played on the first international date of the season.There are several neighbourly clashes with England meeting Scotland at Wembley, Belgium hosting France in Brussels and Sweden entertaining Norway in Stockholm.Other teams will be travelling much further, including world and European champions Spain, who face an exhausting round trip to steamy Guayaquil to play Ecuador, and Uruguay, who travel half way around the world to visit Japan .Uruguay's trip will at least give striker Luis Suarez a break from his troubles at Liverpool, where he has been told he must apologise to his team mates before he will be welcomed back into the squad following a failed bid to move away.Victor Genes will make his debut as Paraguay's fourth coach in only two years as the South Americans visit Germany in Kaiserslautern .The former under-20 coach replaced Gerardo Pelusso who quit in June after a 2-1 home defeat to Chile kept the 2010 World Cup quarter-finalists bottom of the South American qualifying group for the 2014 finals in Brazil.Beleaguered Mexico coach Jose Manuel de la Torre badly needs a win against Ivory Coast in New York following his side's disappointing CONCACAF Gold Cup exit against Panama while the United States, who won the tournament, visit Bosnia in Sarajevo. European clubs frequently complain about the August date, which is played before many domestic leagues have kicked off, and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, president of the European Clubs' Association, once described the games as \"nonsense matches.\"Rummenigge is Bayern Munich's CEO and is hardly likely to be pleased that two of his club's players, Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez, have been included in an experimental Spanish squad for the trip to South America .Italy's meeting with Argentina in Rome is the pick of the crop.The two teams met in four successive World Cups between 1978 and, the last of those games ending in a heart-breaking semi-final defeat for hosts Italy with a Diego Maradona -inspired Argentina winning on penalties after a 1-1 draw.Their only meeting since then was Argentina's 2-1 win in Rome in 2001 when Osvaldo was still a teenager living in Buenos Aires .Osvaldo, who has scored three goals in eight appearances, has been recalled by Italy for the match, having previously fallen foul of coach Cesare Prandelli's code of ethics.The 27-year-old was dropped from the Confederations Cup squad after getting into a public row with AS Roma interim coach Aurelio Andreazzoli during the Italian Cup final against Lazio in May.Born in Buenos Aires, Osvaldo was raised at Huracan where he made his professional debut and moved to Italy as a 20-year-old to join Atalanta .He qualified to play for Italy through his great grandfather and became the latest in the long line of oriundi, as foreign-born national team players are known, when he made his debut in.\n"}
{"_id": 25, "text": "The German striker Lukas Podolski scored two goals and Olivier Giroud grabbed his third goal in as many games as Arsenal recovered from its poor start to the Premier League season with a 3-1 win at Fulham in London on Saturday.Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team bounced back from a home defeat against Aston Villa in convincing manner, exerting control most of the time at Craven Cottage.Giroud scored the opener in the 14th minute with a left- footed shot from close range, and Podolski doubled the visitors' lead four minutes before halftime . Podolski completed the scoring for Arsenal in the 68th after being set up by Santi Cazorla.England forward Darren Bent scored for Fulham in the 77th minute. Wenger, who is still hoping he can make a marquee signing before the end of the transfer period, left England midfielder Jack Wilshere on the bench to give Podolski a start. Fulham Manager Martin Jol started England midfielder Scott Parker, who was acquired from Tottenham last week.The match was played in heavy rain . Arsenal created its first chance after 12 minutes when Theo Walcott's shot was parried by Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale, who replaced the injured Maarten Stekelenburg.Giroud opened the scoring two minutes later, tucking the ball past Stockdale for his third goal in three games in all competitions this season after Aaron Ramsey's attempt deflected into the path of the French striker.\"We picked up where we left off at Fenerbahce and played very well,\" Ramsey said of the win in Turkey . \"Lukas has a lethal left foot and proved that again.\" SOUTHAMPTON TIES Southampton conceded an early goal before grabbing a late equalizer to draw 1-1 against visiting Sunderland in the Premier League .Center back Jos\u00e9 Fonte denied Sunderland its first win of the season with a header that earned the Saints a hard-earned point. Emanuele Giaccherini put Sunderland team ahead in the third minute at St . Mary's after he was left unmarked to head in a corner from Sebastian Larsson. Southampton dominated the second half, and Fonte got the tying goal in the 88th minute with a header. BAYERN MUNICH BEATS NUREMBERG Bayern Munich ground out a hard-fought 2-0 win over Nuremberg to maintain its winning start to the Bundesliga in Germany.Franck Rib\u00e8ry met Philipp Lahm's cross with a header to break the deadlock in the 69th minute, and Arjen Robben sealed the result when he eluded three defenders and scored in the 78th. Bayern toiled to break down the Nuremberg defense, however, in what was the 187th derby between the teams .Schalke's poor start to the season continued with a 2-1 loss at Hannover, where the visitors finished with nine players and the hosts. Bayer Leverkusen beat Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, 4-2, and Freiburg drew, 3-3, at Hoffenheim, where three players were sent off. Wolfsburg midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in a 2-0 defeat at Mainz . VERONA EDGES A.C. MILAN Luca Toni scored twice and host Verona beat A.C. Milan, 2-1, to celebrate its return to Serie A after an 11-year absence as the Italian league opened with a shock.After Andrea Poli put Milan ahead in the 14th minute following a pass from Mario Balotelli, Toni, who is 6 feet 5 inches, struck back with headers in the 30th and 53rd minutes at the Bentegodi stadium.There were concerns that Verona fans might direct racist chants at Balotelli, who is black, but, with the issue discussed widely before the match, supporters responded by applauding him, perhaps sarcastically, whenever he touched the ball .MESSI SITS OUT Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona's Spanish league game at M\u00e1laga on Sunday while he recovers from a muscle injury in his left leg . Barcelona said on Saturday that even though Messi's \"progress is satisfactory,\" Coach Gerardo Martino left the Argentina forward out of his squad as a \"precaution.\"\"We are optimistic, but it's risky to play him again three days later with the league just under way,\" Martino said. \"I think Messi is fine and I'm not worried about what has happened or what's being said. He prepared well during the summer holidays. What happened the other day was a coincidence.\"Messi bruised a muscle in his left thigh during the first half of Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup . With Messi substituted at halftime, the new signing Neymar went on and scored the tying goal, his first goal with his new club.

{"_id": 25, "text": "LONDON \u2014 Some 35 years ago, the English club Sheffield United tried to buy the youthful Diego Maradona, and instead ended up signing Alejandro Sabella.Sabella was no Maradona. He came with two slang nicknames, El Mago (the magician) and Pachorra (the sloth. His skills were decent, but he was overpowered in the English stampede.Today, however, Sabella is the toast of Argentina. He is succeeding where Maradona failed as the national team coach. Maradona's Argentina was wild and wonderful, but in the end horribly undone in defense.Sabella has quietly restructured the side, built it, of course, around Lionel Messi, but he also has given it some semblance of reliability and transition between attack and defense.On Tuesday night in Asunci\u00f3n, where Maradona's side lost en route to the 2010 World Cup, the revamped \"Albiceleste\" devoured Paraguay, 5-2. Messi scored twice, from penalty kicks, but Sabella has made the star man much more of a catalyst, a leader for Tuesday's other strikers, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Maxi Rodr\u00edguez .\"Alejandro has built a great group,\" said Di Mar\u00eda after the victory that sealed Argentina's 11th straight qualification to the World Cup final, stretching back to.In this group, for example, Messi is not expected to be both playmaker and leader of the attack . Fernando Gago calls the shots, or rather guides the momentum, through the midfield, and responsibility is more evenly divided, as it has to be in a team with real pretensions to winning next year's World Cup on Brazilian soil.\"We are on the right path,\" commented Messi, whose career total of 37 goals in 83 games for Argentina eclipses Hern\u00e1n Crespo in the all-time listing. Only Gabriel Batituta's record of 56 goals to go for now for the little maestro.But that isn't in his sights or on his mind. Messi now is thinking \u2014 Sabella has them all thinking \u2014 collectively. \"We have already beaten big teams,\" the captain, Messi said late Tuesday, \"but we still need to make some improvements to be world champions . The World Cup is seven games and you have to be in perfect form.\"It is a measure of Argentina's progress that the players dare to talk of winning the title . Qualifying with two games to spare in the South American group of nine countries (as host, Brazil is prequalified) always has been the toughest assignment in global soccer .Until Tuesday, for example, Colombia led the group. One more victory, and Colombia \u2014 with its canny way of breaking swiftly from defense to feed the striking instincts of Radamel Falcao and Te\u00f3filo Guti\u00e9rrez \u2014 would also have qualified.However, Colombia's game plan was usurped on Tuesday. It lost to two late goals by Edinson Cavani and Cristian Stuani against a Uruguayan team that is the reigning regional champion, and went the furthest among South American teams at the last World Cup in South Africa .With Cavani and Luis Su\u00e1rez in your attack, along with Diego Forl\u00e1n when he is still fit and available, you really ought to have a shot at qualifying . Yet until Tuesday's 2-0 beating of Colombia, Uruguay languished in fifth place. Uruguay still needs victories in its final two group games, and even that might mean nothing more than a play-off against Jordan. South America, you will gather, requires a dogfight even to reach the 32-nation finals that will take place next year on its continent. The qualifying format, with all the nations in the region playing each other, home and away, has no easy matches.The biggest can, and regularly do, fall to the smallest, such as Bolivia, whose advantage is to play home games at high altitude in La Paz .In Europe, by contrast, certain countries are almost honor-bound to qualify once their name gets a lucky draw in the drawing of lots to decide the groupings. Italy and the Netherlands became the continent's first qualifiers this week, both from groups in which it would have been difficult to fail. Germany is a game away from joining them, and Belgium is close.The Asian powers of Iran, Japan and South Korea are already assured of their places, along with Australia, for which FIFA redrew the continental map to make it an Asian contender. The United States should always qualify in its regional grouping, and did so Tuesday, though that comes at the despair of a Mexico squad that is in less than its usual form. And surely Costa Rica is the real achiever this time around in that region of North and Central America and the Caribbean ? Just being there, being a part of the big event in, is its own Holy Grail . But, as you have read from Messi and others, Argentina is eyeing this Cup as a time and a place where it can fulfill potential.And that is where Alex Sabella is working to finally come out of the shadow of Diego Maradona . As players, they were incomparable, but often it is the player who has to work for his living and who has to apply intellect and teamwork who ends up making the better coach.Everything that one hears from Messi, and from the players around him, suggests that this is a going to be a less flamboyant, less gung-ho, team than last time around. We will not know the strength of Brazil until next year because, excused from the qualifying process, the home side has had such precious little competitive fare.Winning the Confederations Cup is like winning the rehearsal. Thrashing the Aussies, 6-0, in Bras\u00edlia, and following that up with a 3-1 victory over Portugal in Boston is good for the soul. But it isn't tempered by the real stuff where you win or die by the results.Hope must spring eternal when you are born in Luxembourg. Not one player there had experienced winning a home World Cup game because 41 years had gone by without the country beating anyone in its modest abode of Stade Josy Barthel. On Tuesday, cheered on by,114 spectators, Luxembourg twice came from a goal down to defeat Northern Ireland, 3-2.\n"}
{"_id": 25, "text": "(Reuters) - Mexico were booed off the field by a boisterous crowd after being held to a 0-0 draw at home to Costa Rica in the final round of CONCACAF qualifying for the 2014 World Cup on Tuesday, their third successive goalless draw at the Azteca Stadium. The United States took control of the six-team qualifying group with an impressive 2-0 win over Panama, while Honduras kept alive their hopes of making it to the finals in Brazil next year with a 2-0 win over bottom team Jamaica.Three teams qualify automatically from CONCACAF to next year's World Cup finals in Brazil while the fourth placed team will meet Oceania winners New Zealand in a two-legged playoff for one further spot. The United States lead at the halfway stage of the qualifying round on 10 points from five games followed by Costa Rica on eight points from the same number of games while Mexico are also on eight points having played an extra game.Honduras have seven points from five games, Panama have six points (five games) and Jamaica two points (six games.Mexico entered the final qualifying round in North and Central America and the Caribbean as strong favorites to top the group but while few would bet against them making it to Brazil, 'El Tri' are making hard work of it.After scoreless draws with Jamaica and the U.S. at home and another away to Panama on Friday, Mexico were under pressure to find their scoring touch but created far too little, which inflamed their fans' passions.As well as the boos at fulltime, the Azteca crowd called for Mexico coach Jose Manuel de la Torre to quit or be sacked while during the game they threw objects onto the field, which could see the Mexican Football Federation fined.The worst occurrence happened when Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz needed police with shields to protect him after he went to take a corner and he was subjected to a barrage of objects, including a plastic bottle, being thrown at him. Costa Rica's disciplined defensive display also added to the Mexicans frustrations after the visitors had almost grabbed an early lead when forward Joel Campbell struck the post in the fourth minute.Campbell then forced Mexico keeper Jose de Jesus Corona into action with a low drive after great work from Cristian Bolanos as the visitors enjoyed the early chances.Two minutes before the break, Ruiz blasted over from a promising position just outside the area.Mexico came out with attacking intent after the break with Carlos Salcido's near post drive well parried by Costa Rica keeper Keilor Navas.At times 'El Tri' laid siege to the Costa Rican penalty area but they lacked invention and there were few clear cut chances as the two sides shared the points.Goals in each half from Jozy Altidore and Eddie Johnson gave Juergen Klinsmann's United States victory over a Panama team who went into the game unbeaten in the final round of qualifying .Altidore slotted home in the 36th minute, getting on the end of a low cross from Fabian Johnson after Michael Bradley had broken from midfield. Eddie Johnson, playing in front of his home crowd in Seattle, then wrapped up the win with a confident finish after a superb cross-field pass from Geoff Cameron .Honduras beat struggling Jamaica after Oscar Boniek Garcia put them ahead in the 10th minute after good work from Roger Espinoza.The Reggae Boyz were reduced to 10 men in the 76th minute when Adrian Mariappa was sent off for a second bookable offence.Honduras wrapped up victory with two minutes remaining when Roger Rojas intercepted a back pass, rounded Donovan Ricketts and slipped the ball into the empty net.\n"}

{"_id": 25, "text": " RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Although his World Cup dream looks distant, Ronaldinho is only one match away from joining a select group of players who have won the European Champions League and the Libertadores Cup, its South American equivalent.The gifted 33-year-old returned to Brazil in January 2011 after a slump in his European career with two objectives - to win a place in his country's 2014 World Cup team and claim the club titles missing from his trophy cabinet .On Wednesday, his Atletico Mineiro team will try to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit in the second leg of the Libertadores Cup final at home to Olimpia of Paraguay in Belo Horizonte .Having inspired Barcelona to the Champions League crown in, Ronaldinho hopes to join Brazilians Dida, Cafu and Roque Junior and Argentines Carlos Tevez, Walter Samuel and Juan Pablo Sorin as champions on the two continents.The match is Ronaldinho's best chance to ensure his return to Brazilian football is not seen as a failure after a string of disappointments. Flamengo brought the twice FIFA World Player of the Year back hoping the deal would have advantages on the field as well as marketing benefits off it, but the project sunk.Ronaldinho spent a troubled 17 months at the Rio club, where he suffered a loss of form blamed on his party lifestyle.In that time, Flamengo only won the minor Carioca ( Rio ) state championship and Ronaldinho left in May 2012 with the club owing him back wages.For Brazil, with whom he won the World Cup in 2002 and also played at the 2006 finals, Ronaldinho appears to have lost his best chance of impressing coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and dropped out of the reckoning for next year's home finals.Thanks to good club performances, especially in the Libertadores Cup, Ronaldinho earned a recall in April for a friendly against Chile at the Mineirao, the newly-refurbished stadium in Atletico's home city Belo Horizonte .On top of a lacklustre performance in a 2-2 draw, Ronaldinho was not forgiven by disciplinarian Scolari for turning up late on the first day of training.\"You invite me to lunch at your home. I get to your house and you're not there. I wait and you, the host, are the last to arrive. The national team goes to the dining table and the last one to arrive? The host, that's not right,\" Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) chief Jose Maria Marin said in a recent interview with Globo Network .Ronaldinho was left out of Brazil's squad for the Confederations Cup last month and is unlikely to find a place in a team that won the title crushing world champions Spain in the final.His talent, however, has never been in doubt and he hopes to shine in the Libertadores Cup final .\"Nothing is greater than the will to bring the title to the 'Galo',\" Ronaldinho said on Twitter using Atletico's nickname 'Cockerel'.\n"}
{"_id": 0, "text": "WASHINGTON With furloughs of air traffic controllers beginning on Sunday, average delays at O'Hare International Airport will be 50 minutes, and 20 at Newark Liberty, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration and the transportation secretary said on Thursday. Los Angeles International will have a shorter average delay, 10 minutes, but peak delays could reach three and a half hours in Atlanta, they said.The numbers come from a computer simulation based on running the system with 10 percent fewer controllers, and using air traffic volumes from March, a Friday, when traffic is usually heavier. As is usually the case, bad weather or equipment breakdowns would impose additional delays. Fully staffed, most of these airports are running with modest delays in good weather .The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, spoke angrily about the problem, caused by the across the board budget cuts known as the sequester. \"This is not what we signed up for,\" Mr. LaHood said in a meeting with reporters. \"This is a dumb idea. Sequestration is a dumb idea. Not one person in America would use sequester to figure out what to do with their budgets .\"\"It's a meat ax approach,\" he said. \" Congress needs to fix it.\"But with no fix in sight, the Transportation Department is preparing to cut 1 billion from its budget by the end of September, including 635 million from the F.A.A. Some of that savings will come from canceling equipment contracts, but most of it will come through unpaid furloughs of one day per 10 day pay period, or 11 days between now and the end of the fiscal year, Mr. LaHood said.Reduced staffing, either in the control towers or at radar rooms distant from the airports, will cut the ability to land airplanes, and in some cases, like O'Hare and Atlanta, may require closing some runways, Mr. LaHood and Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator, said.They listed average and maximum delay times for six hub airports, which they said showed the range of effects, as follows Some airports, like La Guardia, run near their capacity to land aircraft for most hours of the day, and if that rate is cut and a queue develops, they will have little opportunity to recover, the officials said some, like Kennedy Airport, run at their current fully staffed capacity part of the day.The F.A.A.'s plan is to reduce the number of planes allowed in the air to the maximum that can be safely handled by the reduced number of controllers. The agency briefed the airlines earlier this week . The trade association of the major airlines, Airlines for America, said it had three legal opinions that the F.A.A. had \"the discretion to implement cuts without furloughing air traffic controllers,\" but had not acted to do so. The association said it might sue the F.A.A. Antitrust laws would allow the airlines to meet and negotiate mutual reductions in their schedules if the Transportation Department approved, but thus far there is no sign of a plan to do so.In February, the F.A.A. announced plans to close the air traffic control towers at a variety of small airports . Shutting those towers, run by contractors, would have saved money that could have been used elsewhere in the agency, Mr. LaHood and Mr. Huerta said. But the plan was delayed for safety analysis."}
{"_id": 0, "text": "WASHINGTON Two months after Detroit became the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy, top Obama administration officials will be there on Friday to propose nearly 300 million in combined federal and private aid toward a Motown comeback only a fraction of the billions the city owes and a reflection of the budget and political limits on President Obama .This first major infusion from the federal government, which administration officials say will not be the last, would be used to help clear and redevelop blighted properties, improve transportation systems, bolster the police especially around schools and overhaul city management systems wrecked by years of poor administration and inadequate resources.The package follows weeks of meetings in Detroit and at the White House between the administration team and local business, labor and philanthropic leaders on how best to pool existing resources. Final details are to be worked out in a two hour meeting of the federal and local officials at Wayne State University, participants said.While Mr. Obama remains in Washington as fights over the budget and health care threaten a government shutdown at the start of a fiscal year on Tuesday, he is sending a delegation led by his chief White House economic adviser, Gene B. Sperling, which includes three cabinet members Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr . Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development and Anthony R. Foxx, secretary of transportation and a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C. Administration officials acknowledged that the initial aid would hardly solve problems in Detroit that have been decades in the making. But, Mr. Sperling said, \"It's the largest city bankruptcy in the history of our country, on our watch, and we've got to do something.\"Yet the idea of the federal government's responsibility toward Detroit is hardly a settled issue in Washington . Instead, divisions over the question reflect the fundamental divide between the two parties over the size and role of government . Congress, preoccupied with reducing federal deficits, has been all but silent about helping the birthplace of the auto industry and, some say, of the American middle class . The Republican controlled House is hostile to any spending initiatives from Mr. Obama . In the Senate, two Southern Republicans separately and unsuccessfully proposed legislation intended to ban bailouts Detroit leaders have not sought one briefly churning the racial currents at play over a city where four out of five residents are black.So with the chances that Congress would pass any legislation for Detroit \"somewhere between zero and zero,\" as an administration official put it, Mr. Obama has fallen back on what he can do through executive actions, with available money and tax credits, or through partnerships with local businesses and foundations.The effort is similar to the way he has worked around Congress to create advanced manufacturing centers nationwide with federal and local support, provide broadband in every classroom, speed up infrastructure projects and try to reduce gun violence .Even before Friday's event, administration officials worked with Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder, a Republican, to redirect 52 million in federal money to be used to demolish abandoned properties that are blighting communities and discouraging investment.Most of the roughly 300 million to come is federal money, with the state and foundations chipping in, according to the White House . About 140 million would go toward transit improvements, including 24 million to repair buses. An additional 100 million would go to blight efforts, including 25 million for commercial demolitions from combined federal, state and foundation money . With the planned 25 million in federal Homeland Security money, up to 150 firefighters could be hired.\"Our message right from the beginning was There is nothing we can do to help on the bankruptcy there is no bailout,\" said Mr. Sperling, a native of Ann Arbor, Mich. \"However, we want to look at what could we do to help Detroit through existing resources and mobilization \" of public and private partners.\"What we knew, too, was that this was a place where signaling was important,\" he added. \"You want to signal that people are staying with Detroit, that this is still a place to invest, to go.\""}

They said the cuts would be easier to cope with if they had more freedom to decide how to allocate the savings in education, health care and public safety programs.\"We are just saying as you identify the federal cuts and savings give us flexibility to make the cuts where they will do the least harm to our citizens,\" said Gov . Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, a Republican and the vice chairwoman of the association. \"Don't balance the federal budget on the backs of state governments .\" Gov . Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat and the chairman of the association, said \" Deficit reduction should not be accomplished simply by shifting costs from the federal government to the states or by imposing unfunded mandates. States should be given increased flexibility to create efficiencies and to achieve results.\"With more discretion, Mr. Markell said, governors could moderate the effects of the looming cuts.\"We know that cuts are coming, but we don't want to suffer disproportionately,\" Mr. Markell said. \"We want to have some input. We want a seat at the table.\"If the stalemate between Mr. Obama and Congress continues, the across the board cuts will begin to take effect Friday under a budget procedure known as sequestration.\"The uncertainty of sequestration is really harming our states and the national economy,\" Ms. Fallin said. \"I've already had several companies in Oklahoma tell me they are not going to expand because there's so much uncertainty, especially around our military installations . It's projected that we could lose up to,000 military jobs, with a multiplier effect on up to,000 jobs in Oklahoma's economy .\"Mr. Markell said \"The uncertainty of how much will be cut, from where and when, can undermine our budget. It can also slow the economic growth in our states . State economies are slowly recovering and just returning now to the level of revenues we collected back in.\"The governors put aside their partisan disagreements and united in sending an urgent message to Congress .\"We do need to get our national deficit down,\" Ms. Fallin said, \"but give us flexibility. Relax those mandates. Give us some leeway.\" Gov . John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, agreed that the federal deficit and debt were \"a serious risk,\" saying, \"We recognize that we will have to be part of the solution and share the pain.\"But Mr. Hickenlooper said the across the board cuts were a blunt instrument. \"Sequestration was originally designed by both the administration and Congress as something so odious, so repellent, that it would force both sides to a compromise,\" he said. Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican, said Congress should be \"more strategic\" in making cuts.\"I think there should be limited government, but I don't like random changes,\" Mr. Walker said. \"If you look at my budget, I did not do across the board cuts.\" Gov . Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, a Democrat, said the automatic cuts could force layoffs of,000 workers at the Pacific Command and Pearl Harbor .\"That will undermine our capacity for readiness at Pearl Harbor,\" Mr. Abercrombie said, and it symbolizes what happens when Congress fails to meet its responsibilities."}
{"_id": 0, "text": "DENVER Hundreds of abandoned drilling wells dot eastern Wyoming like sagebrush, vestiges of a natural gas boom that has been drying up in recent years as prices have plummeted.The companies that once operated the wells have all but vanished into the prairie, many seeking bankruptcy protection and unable to pay the cost of reclaiming the land they leased. Recent estimates have put the number of abandoned drilling operations in Wyoming at more than,200, and state officials said several thousand more might soon be orphaned by their operators . Wyoming officials are now trying to address the problem amid concerns from landowners that the wells could contaminate groundwater and are a blight on the land.This month, Gov . Matt Mead proposed allocating 3 million to pay for plugging the wells and reclaiming the land around them. And the issue is expected to be debated during next year's legislative session as lawmakers seek to hold drilling companies more accountable.\"The downturn in natural gas prices has forced small operators out of business, and the problem has really accelerated over the last couple of years,\" said the governor's policy director, Shawn Reese. \" Landowners would like their land to be brought back to a productive status and have orphaned wells cleaned up.\"Drilling companies in Wyoming typically lease land from the state, private owners or the federal Bureau of Land Management, depending on who owns the mineral rights.The state's Oil and Gas Conservation Commission already budgets 1 million a year to plug abandoned wells. And under the governor's proposal, the commission would appropriate another 3 million over the next four years in an effort to restore property value and reduce the risk of contamination.The money would come from a conservation tax that oil and gas companies pay.Still, given the number of wells already abandoned and the concern that more will soon be deserted, the money is not expected to go far. The state estimated that closing the,200 wells already abandoned would cost about 8 million .Compounding the problem, state officials estimate that Wyoming may also have to plug,300 wells that are sitting idle but have not been entirely abandoned by operators .There are also 400 idle wells scattered across land owned by the Bureau of Land Management, which has its own criteria for determining when a well on its land is considered abandoned or idle. State officials said they would need to work with the bureau to help deal with those wells, too. Governor Mead also wants the commission, which he sits on, to review the conservation tax and bonding requirements for drilling companies to determine whether they are sufficient.Currently, companies must pay a,000 blanket bond to cover all of the wells they operate often numbering in the hundreds on state and private land in Wyoming . Once a well stops producing and is deemed idle, the operator must pay up to 10 a linear foot in bonding to offset the cost of reclamation.But it is at that point that some companies drift into financial trouble and cannot pay the additional fees, leaving the state to scramble to make up the cost.The governor's proposal has drawn support from landowner groups like the Powder River Basin Coalition, which has been pushing the state to take a tougher tack toward financially marginal drilling companies .\"There has been a lot of hand holding and coddling over the years when it comes to oil and gas operators and their ability to pay the bonding,\" said Jill Morrison, an organizer with the group.Ms. Morrison said that the issue had largely been ignored during Wyoming's peak boom years from 1995 to.\"We are really pleased there is an actual plan to move forward with an aggressive plugging and reclamation strategy,\" she said.The proposal is also backed by the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, which favors raising the conservation tax to help pay for plugging fees. The group also supports higher bond fees for operators with tenuous finances .\"It's how you weed out companies that are too risky to go into business with,\" said the group's president, Bruce Hinchey.But getting drilling companies who claim to be on the verge of collapse to take responsibility for wells they still technically own has proved difficult.One such company, Patriot Energy Resources, which owns about 900 idle wells on state and private land, said in an October letter to Governor Mead that it was.9 million short of full bonding on those wells after the bankruptcy filing of Luca Technologies, its parent company .Patriot has proposed allowing another drilling company to take on a part of its debt, saying it will have to abandon its wells otherwise. \"Without this deal or something similar, Patriot will be forced to file for bankruptcy and turn these wells and reservoirs over to the state of Wyoming,\" a company official wrote in the letter.Renny MacKay, a spokesman for Mr. Mead, said the state was weighing the offer. State Senator John J. Hines, a Republican who represents mineral rich Campbell and Converse Counties, said it was vital for lawmakers to take up the issue swiftly, because natural gas was so important to Wyoming's economy .\"All of this just came to a head at once,\" said Mr. Hines, who heads the Senate's minerals committee .Last spring, Mr. Hines was told by Patriot that the hum of gas drilling activity on his own sprawling cattle ranch would soon grow quiet.Soon after, the company, which leased parcels of Mr. Hines's land, disappeared completely leaving behind more than 40 coal bed methane wells and a jumble of pipes and pumps.\"They informed me that they were shutting down because they were short of funds,\" Mr. Hines said. \"All of it, in my opinion, needs to be cleaned up.\""}
{"_id": 0, "text": "WASHINGTON As the White House and Congress careen toward another fiscal showdown, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned on Tuesday that President Obama and lawmakers have been cutting the wrong kind of federal spending as they try to avoid the unsustainable buildup of debt that is projected in the coming decades.Annual federal deficits will continue to fall in the short term, the budget office reported in its yearly long term outlook, because of the recent spending cuts in military and domestic programs and rising tax collections in a recovering economy . The report projected the deficit in 2015 to be equal to.1 percent of the economy's output, or just one fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in.But starting in, deficits are projected to rise again as more baby boomers begin drawing from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security the fast growing entitlement programs, which Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to rein in.The accumulating federal debt, which averaged 38 percent of the gross domestic product for the 40 years before the 2008 financial crisis, would rise from 73 percent of the G.D.P. now above what most economists consider an optimum level to at least 100 percent in.Budget experts have been warning since at least the Reagan era that in the early 21 st century, aging baby boomers will drive entitlement spending chiefly for Medicare and Medicaid, and to a lesser degree for Social Security to levels that will crowd out all other military and domestic spending . Interest on the debt will also be a major and growing expense .What is different now is that the Republican controlled House and the White House have been on a two year run of deficit reduction that has resulted, because of their inability to agree on entitlement reductions and higher tax revenues, in deepening cuts in the budget areas that are not responsible for the projections of mounting debt . Those discretionary spending programs which include things as varied as Pentagon weapons purchases, air traffic control, science and research, education and national parks are being squeezed even as entitlement spending grows automatically. The budget office said that by, the annual deficit would rise to an estimated .5 percent of the G.D.P., which is just beyond the level that many economists consider sustainable in a growing economy . By, it would be.5 percent.Under a nine year plan starting in the 2011 fiscal year, discretionary spending was already being reduced annually. But the across the board \"sequester\" that took effect in March, when Republicans and Mr. Obama could not agree on alternative deficit reductions, has pared domestic and military programs further, resulting in increasing layoffs, furloughs and service cutbacks. Republicans have supported keeping the sequestration cuts in place rather than accepting Mr. Obama's proposal for a mix of higher taxes on wealthy people and some corporations and cuts in future entitlement spending . And he has said he will not accept their alternative for deeper reductions in Medicare and Medicaid without tax increases . Federal spending for the major health programs and Social Security will equal 14 percent of the G.D.P. in 25 years, double the level of the last four decades, the budget office projected. While federal revenues are projected to grow to.5 percent of the G.D.P. by, compared with the 40 year average of.5 percent that rise is not enough to offset the spending for federal benefit programs .In contrast with entitlement spending, discretionary spending for domestic and military programs by 2023 would fall to.3 percent of the G.D.P., from the.3 percent of this year the lowest levels in about 70 years.\"Unless substantial changes are made to the major health care programs and Social Security,\" the report said, \"those programs will absorb a much larger share of the economy's total output in the future than they have in the past.\""}

Meanwhile, the mayor has simply stopped talking about what is on nearly everyone's mind in this troubled city.All across Detroit, tension is building as a state appointed emergency manager prepares to take control of the city government on Monday and begin a drastic restructuring of its finances and operations.\"There is anxiety. There is fear of the unknown,\" said Yolanda Langston, the president of a Service Employees International Union's local in Detroit . \"We don't know which way he's going to go.\"Since Gov .Rick Snyderannounced the state takeover on March, there has been a dearth of information about the first steps in the long awaited turnaround of Detroit .But that will change at 01 a.m. Monday, when Kevyn D. Orr, a 54 year old bankruptcy lawyer from Washington, is given the authority to fix the city however he sees fit.Mr. Orr has spent the past week entrenched in a state office building in downtown Detroit, poring over briefing books and privately meeting with outside consultants and behind the scenes supporters in the city.He has so far held back from talking with elected officials, union leaders and creditors even as speculation grows about how he will tackle the cash shortfalls and huge long term liabilities that have crippled many city services for Detroit's,000 residents.Yet he knows that once he is on the job, he will have to generate cooperation for some painful measures or force them on people who already resent his appointment.\"I'm used to meeting resistance,\" Mr. Orr said in an interview, alluding to his legal career in bankruptcy court . \"What I'm hoping is that once we get into it and get rid of some of the initial angst and concern, we'll move to the rule of reason.\"The Republican governor's decision to install an emergency manager for the Democratic controlled city had been widely expected for months. Still, the reality of a state takeover of its largest city has left many here shocked and visibly nervous about the future.At the City Council's last meeting before the takeover, some residents vented their anger, while Council members wondered aloud if they would have any statutory powers at all once Mr. Orr took office.\"I am angry, like so many thousands of other residents of Detroit,\" said Kathy Montgomery, 64. \"Angry that our governor and mayor decided we need an emergency manager . We must oppose them.\"The emergency manager law gives Mr. Orr extraordinary powers to reshape the city, including eliminating Council members' salaries .\"I don't know what kind of role we can have,\" said Brenda Jones, one of nine City Council members . \"I feel that we are just sitting here as a symbolic symbol right now.\"MayorDave Bing, who chose at the final hour not to oppose Mr. Orr's appointment, will not publicly discuss what happens next. At a news conference on Friday on new police initiatives, he declined to answer questions about Mr. Orr .Resistance, however, is building among some more vocal opponents, like the city's Council of Baptist Pastors, which has called for a lawsuit to block Mr. Orr's appointment.The president of the Detroit chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., the Rev. Wendell Anthony, said he expected to see protests in the coming week. \"It's not about how we should brace for Mr. Orr,\" he said. \"Mr. Orr should brace for Detroit .\"Reaction to Mr. Orr's arrival has been more favorable among business leaders and other community groups . And even as some union leaders worry about job cuts, others hope for a dialogue that minimizes reductions.Mr. Orr, for his part, said he was eager to begin fruitful negotiations, while at the same time reserving the possibility of a bankruptcy filing that would void city contracts.\"You never want to enter a situation by taking anything off the table,\" he said. \"You have to be honest.\"He can expect the same candor in return from the chiefs of the police and fire unions, groups that have absorbed repeated personnel and budget cuts despite increases in homicides and arsons."}

{"_id": 0, "text": "WASHINGTON By mid February or early March, the United States could face an unprecedented default unless it raises its debt ceiling, the Treasury Department said this week.Some legislators have theorized that a quick breach in the debt ceiling might cause only a minor disruption to government finances . And some commentators have suggested that the United States could pass legislation to prioritize or guarantee payments to bondholders, thus erasing what they describe as the worst of the financial market reaction and removing the threat of technical default.But experts in government finance and markets described running up against the debt ceiling as an event that might quickly precipitate a financial crisis and eventually lead to a recession an event with far greater disruptive potential than the \" fiscal cliff \" package of tax increases and spending cuts, a government shutdown or even the collapse of Lehman Brothers .A debt ceiling crisis would be at its heart a cash management problem. Every day the government receives millions of bills to pay, to its employees, older Americans, soldiers, bondholders and contractors, among others. Under normal circumstances, it makes payments with new revenue as well as with the proceeds from bond sales . But the country has already run out of authority to issue new debt, as of Dec. 31, and Congress has not yet raised the statutory debt ceiling, currently around.4 trillion. The Treasury Department is undertaking \" extraordinary measures,\" like suspending the reinvestment of certain government retirement funds, to leave it with more cash on hand . But such measures buy the country only so much time, and in a matter of weeks outflows will overwhelm inflows .That day might be Feb. 15, for instance. According to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis, the government expects about 9 billion in revenue to arrive in its coffers that day. But it has 52 billion in committed spending on that day 30 billion in interest payments, 6.8 billion in tax refunds, 3.5 billion in federal salaries, 2.7 billion in military pay, 2.3 billion in Medicaid and Medicare payments, 1.5 billion owed to military contractors and a smattering of other commitments.The Treasury would be confronted with paying doctors but not soldiers, Chinese bondholders but not defense companies . Worse, it is not clear whether the Treasury secretary would have the legal latitude or even the technical ability to prioritize some payments over others. Every day the country remained in breach of the ceiling, the problems would be compounded. The Treasury Department has shed little light on what actions it would take if the country breached the ceiling.But there are a few clues as to how the Obama administration might react. A Treasury inspector general's report from last year described some of the planning for the debt ceiling standoff in, which caused a broad slump in the market and raised the country's borrowing costs by about.3 billion in that fiscal year. \"Treasury considered asset sales imposing across the board payment reductions various ways of attempting to prioritize payments and various ways of delaying payments,\" the report said.It determined that delaying payments might be the least harmful option, but made no decisions about the best route forward. Moreover, \"Treasury reached the same conclusion that other administrations had reached about these options none of them could reasonably protect the full faith and credit of the U.S., the American economy, or individual citizens from very serious harm,\" the report said.Some Republican lawmakers have suggested giving the Treasury more guidance. For instance, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida has put forward a bill ordering the Treasury to pay obligations to bondholders, followed by troops, national security \"priorities,\" Social Security and then Medicare .But organized chaos would still be chaos, analysts said. Consider again the day of Feb. 15. The country would not have enough money to pay its bondholders, let alone anyone else. Moreover, analysts have raised questions about whether the Treasury would be able to reprogram its automated payment systems to prioritize some payments over others. With bills stacking up day by day, the government would be able to make only about 60 percent of its payments over time. Businesses and individuals would be left without expected funds from the government, and a tremendous financial crisis might ensue. \"We're the reserve currency of the entire world,\" said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center, in Washington . \"There's trillions of dollars of our debt sliced and diced into all sorts of financial instruments around the world. If you're a 28 year old bond trader for Nomura in Tokyo, and someone says, 'Hey, we just heard a rumor Treasury isn't making all its payments,' what do you do? You panic and you sell.\"For that reason, 84 percent of the top economists surveyed by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business this week said the debt ceiling \"periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes\" for the country.\"Deciding whether or not to pay the debts incurred to fund the previously approved tax and spending is nuts,\" responded Anil K. Kashyap of the University of Chicago .Richard H. Thaler, also of Chicago, said, \"The debt ceiling is a dumb idea with no benefits and potentially catastrophic costs if ever used.\"A standoff in the debt ceiling even a brief one, with bondholders paid on time might also raise the country's borrowing costs permanently. \"It is not assured that the Treasury would or legally could prioritize debt service over its myriad other obligations, including Social Security payments, tax rebates and payments to contractors and employees,\" Fitch, the major ratings agency, said on Tuesday. \" Arrears on such obligations would not constitute a default event from a sovereign rating perspective but very likely prompt a downgrade even as debt obligations continued to be met.\"For that reason, some Republicans are shying away from using the debt ceiling as leverage with some quietly suggesting that a forthcoming debate over the continuing spending resolution necessary to finance the government might be a better time to wrangle for budget cuts .In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Speaker John A. Boehner described the debt ceiling as \"one point of leverage\" but \"not the ultimate leverage.\" The White House has refused to negotiate any budget cuts as part of talks over the ceiling, and has suggested that Congress give up most its authority over the debt ceiling to begin with."}
{"_id": 0, "text": "DETROIT A review team appointed by the State of Michigan has concluded that Detroit is mired in serious financial problems, a step that draws the city ever closer to emergency oversight by a state assigned financial manager.If Gov . Rick Snyder concurs with the findings in the coming days, state officials will appoint an emergency financial manager who would try to solve the city's financial woes, and if that fails could ultimately urge Detroit to enter into bankruptcy proceedings .In a way, the review team's conclusion, announced on Tuesday, seemed inevitable in a city that has wrestled with more than 14 billion in long term liabilities, nearly annual projections of imminent cash shortfalls and a population and accompanying tax base that has plunged to,000 residents from.8 million decades ago . Still, it is an outcome that many of Detroit's political leaders have fought for years to avoid, racing in recent months to cut costs and collect more revenue as proof that the city can solve its own problems.The team's findings called new, undesired attention to the dismal financial circumstances of government operations in Detroit, a city that by some other measures has experienced a period of renaissance and private investment in recent years . It also raised the prospect of growing political and racial tension between the city, where the population is about 83 percent black and many leaders are Democrats, and the state, where the population is nearly 80 percent white and Republicans, including Mr. Snyder, control the capital.Along the streets here on a blustery, frigid day, Detroiters expressed a mix of views about the prospect of state intervention. Some suggested that the notion violated the role of the city's elected leaders, while others seemed unconcerned about who fixes the city's problems as long as someone does.On Tuesday, it remained conceivable that Detroit might yet avoid a state appointed emergency financial manager, though many here suggested that the odds of that now appeared slim and Mr. Snyder has in recent days been studying a pool of possible candidates for the job.Under a Michigan law aimed at sparing the state's most financially troubled cities from failure, Mr. Snyder could within 30 days reject the conclusion that Detroit's situation is dire. Or, should he agree with that conclusion, Detroit officials could still appeal the decision . The city could also enter into a legal agreement with the state, laying out plans for remaking the city's finances with no emergency manager . However, just such an agreement was enacted last April, and some state officials say it has failed to go far enough to solve Detroit's crisis .\"We believe there's a financial emergency in the city, and there's no plan in place to correct the situation,\" said Andy Dillon, Michigan's state treasurer and a member of a six person review team that examined Detroit's finances over the past two months.The review team found a city troubled for years with cash shortfalls including one expected to reach 100 million by June as well as repeated general fund deficits, dealt with mostly by issuing long term debt . In the 2012 fiscal year, that general fund deficit reached more than 326 million .But the city's long term liabilities more than 14 billion may be the larger problem, the review team's report suggested.Detroit's problems are by no means simple or new, and some have questioned whether even an emergency manager someone meant to have few political considerations and an unsentimental perspective on city operations will be able to turn things around .In only the last four years, the number of city employees has been reduced to,696 from more than,400 to save money, and some people argue that the only way to financial stability will be through more cuts, furloughs and benefit reductions. Yet at the same time, residents here complain about slow city services and a significant increase in murders in, and some say police and fire protection needs more investment, not budget cutting .The city's geography is itself another puzzle. The cradle of the American auto industry and once the nation's fourth most populous city, Detroit remains vast at 139 square miles a city suited to a larger population and city services to match. But it is now left with pockets of empty lots, shuttered homes and a continuing foreclosure problem in the face of high unemployment .If an emergency financial manager is ultimately appointed here, that person will have relatively broad powers to reshape Detroit's budget, but will be unable, at least temporarily, to throw out existing labor contracts, as had been permitted under a sweeping emergency manager law that voters statewide rejected last November. Since then, the governor and legislators have passed new provisions for emergency managers, which take effect in late March and grant such managers more control over labor contracts .Under Michigan law, an outside manager could eventually help lead the city into bankruptcy proceedings an outcome that few in Detroit or Lansing see as wise or likely but that some have come to talk about as a real consideration. Municipalities rarely wind up pursuing such a course, known as Chapter, and if Detroit were to do so, it would be the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy in terms of size of debt as well as city population.Around the nation, states have used a variety of approaches, including appointed receivers and oversight boards, to step in when cities are teetering toward failure. Their role and authority range widely, as do views about whether they ultimately work. A financial control board helped New York City regain its footing in the 1970s. In Michigan, five cities and three school districts are already under the supervision of an emergency financial manager, but the prospect of outside oversight for Detroit, given its size and history, draws especially pointed reactions. Mayor Dave Bing, a Democrat who has spent much of his four years in office focused on trying to solve Detroit's financial woes and has yet to announce whether he will seek re election this year, has in the past said the city needs no takeover by an emergency manager . Still, even during discussions of cost cutting in recent months, Mr. Bing and Detroit's City Council have sometimes clashed over what to do. And earlier administrations including that of Kwame Kilpatrick, a former mayor accused of corruption whose fate was being weighed here by a federal jury on Tuesday have left behind a financial crisis, Mr. Bing has said.On Tuesday, Mr. Bing said even he was unsurprised by the review team's conclusion. \"My administration has been saying for the past four years that the city is under financial stress,\" he said, adding, \"If the governor decides to appoint an emergency financial manager, he or she, like my administration, is going to need resources particularly in the form of cash and additional staff.\""}
{"_id": 0, "text": "AUSTIN, Tex. The last time Texas lawmakers began a legislative session, a cost cutting fervor filled the marble hallways of the Capitol in January 2011 as the state faced a budget shortfall of as much as 27 billion. Legislators warned of sparing nothing and no one from deep cutbacks from highways, to prisons, to health care for the poor, to programs for preschool children.Two years later, as lawmakers met Tuesday for the opening of the Legislature, the state's financial picture was not nearly as dire. A boom in revenues from sales taxes as well as taxes from oil and natural gas production have given Texas a budget surplus that the state comptroller has estimated at.8 billion.But the question of what to do with the surplus is proving just as contentious as debate over the shortfall two years ago, and will most likely frame much of the wrangling throughout the fast paced 140 day regular session . Republican and Democratic members of the State House and Senate have offered competing visions of how to use the surplus and how the state should respond to rapid population growth, severe drought, the federal health care overhaul and a host of other issues. Education advocates and Democratic lawmakers have called for the Legislature to restore some or all of the.4 billion cuts made to public education in the 2011 session. But Republican leaders and other fiscal conservatives have expressed reluctance to finance anything beyond growth in student enrollment particularly when a lawsuit against the state over how it finances public education will not be resolved until later in the year.\"I think there's going to be a group of people who think we've got the money, we need to spend it,\" said Representative Jim Pitts, Republican of Waxahachie and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee . \"I think there's going to be a group of people who think we need to cut our budget more. The session could be very difficult because of those two groups of people pushing us.\"Shortly after noon inside the Capitol's Senate chamber, Gov . Rick Perry told senators that the comptroller's revenue estimate released the day before was good news, but cautioned them to retain the state's fiscally conservative model. Mr. Perry has called on lawmakers to support his so called Texas Budget Compact, a Tea Party style pledge to oppose new taxes and to replace the current spending limit for the state budget with an even stricter formula.\"There are interests all across the state who view Monday's revenue estimates as the equivalent of ringing the dinner bell,\" Mr. Perry said, adding, \"However, in the face of that kind of pressure, we have to remember that Monday's revenue estimate represents not a chance to spend freely, but an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the very policies that have made Texas economically strong.\"Mr. Perry's speech rankled some Democrats, who described the increased revenues as a \"so called surplus,\" because services for public education, health care and other programs had been slashed statewide . \"That's why you raise revenue to spend it wisely,\" said Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat . \"There's not a state agency in this state that is being adequately funded. Higher ed, public ed, social services, highways, parks all of them are hurting. You shouldn't start out by saying, 'No.' No is not a program.\"Mr. Perry's remarks to the senators were interrupted briefly when a member of Mr. Whitmire's staff who had been standing at the back of the chamber collapsed. Senators and others rushed to help her, but she appeared to be unharmed. When Mr. Perry stepped to the microphone again, he quipped, to applause and laughter, \"I have not had that kind of impact on anyone in a long time.\"Mr. Perry has been busy building up his political capital, and perhaps his own ego, after his unsuccessful campaign for president. He has indicated that he is considering running for re election in 2014 and has not ruled out making another run for the White House in. His influence over the Legislature in light of his possible future campaigns remains an unknown factor as the session gets under way, but many believe his stumble on the national stage has not set him back in his home state .\"He now looks a little more human maybe after his presidential run,\" said Michael Quinn Sullivan, the president of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility. \"But don't confuse looking human with looking weak. The governor is still the governor .\"In Texas, lawmakers convene every other year and set state spending in a two year budget cycle. While the 83rd Legislature was already being called one of the state's most inexperienced with nearly 50 first time legislators in the House and Senate it was also described by some as likely to be one of the most conservative. Republican leaders, including Mr. Perry, have expressed support for a so called \" fetal pain \" bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy . In addition, lawmakers have proposed requiring those applying for welfare and unemployment benefits to undergo drug testing and allowing teachers who are licensed to carry concealed handguns to wear their weapons in the classroom.But aside from those proposals, the surplus has allowed the Legislature to focus on issues that have often been pushed aside in leaner budget times, including seeking new ways to finance long delayed infrastructure projects, like the building of roads and reservoirs.Though they lost their supermajority in the House in the November elections, Republicans continue to control both chambers of the Legislature and to hold every statewide elected office . But the tone of the session will likely be set not only by numbers, but by the political dynamics at play.The far right agenda of grass roots and Tea Party activists has come to dominate the Republican Party in Texas, turning moderate Republicans into an endangered species for the most part. Mainstream Republicans are likely to use the legislative session to bolster their conservative credentials, particularly after Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite, defeated one of the state's most powerful Republicans, Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst, in a United States Senate race last year.Mr. Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate as lieutenant governor and has indicated he plans to run for re election, said that his campaign taught him a number of things including doing a better job communicating his accomplishments to voters but that his conservative record was impeccable. \"To be up in Washington as a freshman senator in which nothing's going to go on, you're going to have gridlock so noisy you can't hear,\" he said. \"I'm glad to be here.\""}
{"_id": 1, "text": "WASHINGTON When American analysts hunting terrorists sought new ways to comb through the troves of phone records, e mails and other data piling up as digital communications exploded over the past decade, they turned to Silicon Valley computer experts who had developed complex equations to thwart Russian mobsters intent on credit card fraud.The partnership between the intelligence community and Palantir Technologies, a Palo Alto, Calif., company founded by a group of inventors from PayPal, is just one of many that the National Security Agency and other agencies have forged as they have rushed to unlock the secrets of \"Big Data.\"Today, a revolution in software technology that allows for the highly automated and instantaneous analysis of enormous volumes of digital information has transformed the N.S.A., turning it into the virtual landlord of the digital assets of Americans and foreigners alike. The new technology has, for the first time, given America's spies the ability to track the activities and movements of people almost anywhere in the world without actually watching them or listening to their conversations.New disclosures that the N.S.A. has secretly acquired the phone records of millions of Americans and access to e mails, videos and other data of foreigners from nine United States Internet companies have provided a rare glimpse into the growing reach of the nation's largest spy agency . They have also alarmed the government on Saturday night, Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, said that \"a crimes report has been filed by the N.S.A.\"With little public debate, the N.S.A. has been undergoing rapid expansion in order to exploit the mountains of new data being created each day. The government has poured billions of dollars into the agency over the last decade, building a one million square foot fortress in the mountains of Utah, apparently to store huge volumes of personal data indefinitely. It created intercept stations across the country, according to former industry and intelligence officials, and helped build one of the world's fastest computers to crack the codes that protect information.While once the flow of data across the Internet appeared too overwhelming for N.S.A. to keep up with, the recent revelations suggest that the agency's capabilities are now far greater than most outsiders believed. \"Five years ago, I would have said they don't have the capability to monitor a significant amount of Internet traffic,\" said Herbert S. Lin, an expert in computer science and telecommunications at the National Research Council. Now, he said, it appears \"that they are getting close to that goal.\"On Saturday, it became clear how close Another N.S.A. document, again cited by The Guardian, showed a \"global heat map\" that appeared to represent how much data the N.S.A. sweeps up around the world. It showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide about 14 percent of it was in Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that might have been foreign data traffic routed through American based servers.The agency's ability to efficiently mine metadata, data about who is calling or e mailing, has made wiretapping and eavesdropping on communications far less vital, according to data experts. That access to data from companies that Americans depend on daily raises troubling questions about privacy and civil liberties that officials in Washington, insistent on near total secrecy, have yet to address.\"American laws and American policy view the content of communications as the most private and the most valuable, but that is backwards today,\" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington group. \"The information associated with communications today is often more significant than the communications itself, and the people who do the data mining know that.\"In the 1960s, when the N.S.A. successfully intercepted the primitive car phones used by Soviet leaders driving around Moscow in their Zil limousines, there was no chance the agency would accidentally pick up Americans. Today, if it is scanning for a foreign politician's Gmail account or hunting for the cellphone number of someone suspected of being a terrorist, the possibilities for what N.S.A. calls \"incidental\" collection of Americans are far greater. United States laws restrict wiretapping and eavesdropping on the actual content of the communications of American citizens but offer very little protection to the digital data thrown off by the telephone when a call is made. And they offer virtually no protection to other forms of non telephone related data like credit card transactions .Because of smartphones, tablets, social media sites, e mail and other forms of digital communications, the world creates.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily, according to I.B.M."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "WASHINGTON Since, the National Security Agency has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans' social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information, according to newly disclosed documents and interviews with officials .The spy agency began allowing the analysis of phone call and e mail logs in November 2010 to examine Americans' networks of associations for foreign intelligence purposes after N.S.A. officials lifted restrictions on the practice, according to documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.The policy shift was intended to help the agency \"discover and track\" connections between intelligence targets overseas and people in the United States, according to an N.S.A. memorandum from January. The agency was authorized to conduct \" large scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications metadata without having to check foreignness\" of every e mail address, phone number or other identifier, the document said. Because of concerns about infringing on the privacy of American citizens, the computer analysis of such data had previously been permitted only for foreigners.The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data, according to the documents. They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of such \"enrichment\" data, and several former senior Obama administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans and foreigners.N.S.A. officials declined to say how many Americans have been caught up in the effort, including people involved in no wrongdoing. The documents do not describe what has resulted from the scrutiny, which links phone numbers and e mails in a \"contact chain\" tied directly or indirectly to a person or organization overseas that is of foreign intelligence interest.The new disclosures add to the growing body of knowledge in recent months about the N.S.A.'s access to and use of private information concerning Americans, prompting lawmakers in Washington to call for reining in the agency and President Obama to order an examination of its surveillance policies. Almost everything about the agency's operations is hidden, and the decision to revise the limits concerning Americans was made in secret, without review by the nation's intelligence court or any public debate . As far back as, a Justice Department memo warned of the potential for the \" misuse \" of such information without adequate safeguards.An agency spokeswoman, asked about the analyses of Americans' data, said, \"All data queries must include a foreign intelligence justification, period.\"\"All of N.S.A.'s work has a foreign intelligence purpose,\" the spokeswoman added. \"Our activities are centered on counterterrorism, counterproliferation and cybersecurity .\"The legal underpinning of the policy change, she said, was a 1979 Supreme Court ruling that Americans could have no expectation of privacy about what numbers they had called. Based on that ruling, the Justice Department and the Pentagon decided that it was permissible to create contact chains using Americans' \" metadata,\" which includes the timing, location and other details of calls and e mails, but not their content. The agency is not required to seek warrants for the analyses from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .N.S.A. officials declined to identify which phone and e mail databases are used to create the social network diagrams, and the documents provided by Mr. Snowden do not specify them. The agency did say that the large database of Americans' domestic phone call records, which was revealed by Mr. Snowden in June and caused bipartisan alarm in Washington, was excluded. (N.S.A. officials have previously acknowledged that the agency has done limited analysis in that database, collected under provisions of the Patriot Act, exclusively for people who might be linked to terrorism suspects .)But the agency has multiple collection programs and databases, the former officials said, adding that the social networking analyses relied on both domestic and international metadata . They spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the information was classified."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "WASHINGTON The March 2004 confrontation in the hospital room of Attorney General John Ashcroft a dramatic point in the Bush administration's internal debate over warrantless surveillance was apparently set off by a secret National Security Agency program that was vacuuming up \" metadata \" logs of Internet communications, according to a draft of a 2009 N.S.A. inspector general report obtained by the British newspaper The Guardian .The report, the latest document given to the paper by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, may clear up a long running mystery over which program White House officials wanted Mr. Ashcroft and other Justice Department officials to sign off on when they went to his Washington hospital room . Because of their refusal, according to the report, the Bush administration shut down the metadata collection for several months, then re established it under a secret order from a national security court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.The program continued to operate for the first two years of the Obama administration but has since ended, Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence, said Thursday.\"The Internet metadata collection program authorized by the FISA court was discontinued in 2011 for operational and resource reasons and has not been restarted,\" Mr. Turner said. \"The program was discontinued by the executive branch as a result of an interagency review.\"A separate N.S.A. program that has been collecting domestic \"telephone metadata \" logs of all telephone calls dialed by Americans has continued. That program was among the first of Mr. Snowden's revelations. It is not clear whether Internet metadata collection has continued under a different program.The N.S.A. uses the metadata to analyze links between people to try to identify networks of terrorism suspects, a process the report calls \"contact chaining.\" The inspector general report says they typically \"analyzed networks with two degrees of separation (two hops)\" from the known suspect to create investigative leads submitted to the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. in reports they called tippers.The content of the inspector general report a history of the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance programs, which eventually came under court oversight was first reported by The Washington Post .President Bush's original surveillance program, established on Oct. 4, 2001, had four components. It sucked up the contents of telephone calls and e mails, as well as their \" metadata \" logs. This was done without court orders and outside statutory regulations, and was based on closely held legal memorandums even the N.S.A.'s general counsel was not allowed to see them at first, according to the report, which invoked the president's inherent powers as commander in chief .Over time, however, there was turnover at the Justice Department, including the arrival of a new head at its Office of Legal Counsel, Jack Goldsmith, and a new deputy attorney general, James B. Comey, who last week was nominated by President Obama to be director of the F.B.I.In December, Mr. Goldsmith began to question the legality of some aspects of the programs, and he persuaded Mr. Comey who took over temporarily as attorney general when Mr. Ashcroft became ill the following March not to sign a document reauthorizing it.The report says that the Justice Department's concerns were focused on the Internet metadata program, which was then based on a theory that the N.S.A. did not \"acquire,\" for legal purposes, the bulk communications when it collected them, but instead only when human analysts selected certain data to examine because it met certain criteria.In the hospital room confrontation of March, 2004, Mr. Ashcroft refused a request by senior White House aides to overrule Mr. Comey and sign off on extending the program. The report says that on March, after taking into account the objections of Mr. Comey and his allies, Mr. Bush rescinded his authorization to the N.S.A. to collect bulk Internet metadata and gave the agency a week to stop collecting it and to block access to its existing database.During the same month, the report says, the Bush administration also ended the secret domestic surveillance programs against Iraq it had begun the year before under a theory that Iraqi spies were \"engaged in terrorist activities and presented a threat to U.S. interests in the United States and abroad .\" The credibility of Bush administration claims linking Iraq to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups was, at the time, a subject of deep controversy. It is not clear whether ending the program was a coincidence or connected to the Justice Department's rebellion against the White House over the administration's legal theories about surveillance .After Mr. Bush's order to end the collection of Internet metadata, administration lawyers looked for a new legal basis to restart the program. Under this theory, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court could authorize such bulk collection under a \"pen register trap trace\" statute, which traditionally allows law enforcement officials to keep logs of communications sent and received by particular phone numbers or e mail accounts."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "WASHINGTON The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Obama administration on Tuesday over its \"dragnet\" collection of logs of domestic phone calls, contending that the once secret program whose existence was exposed last week by a former National Security Agency contractor is illegal and asking a judge to stop it and order the records purged.The lawsuit could set up an eventual Supreme Court test. It could also focus attention on this disclosure amid the larger heap of top secret surveillance matters revealed by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who came forward Sunday to say he was their source.The program \"gives the government a comprehensive record of our associations and public movements, revealing a wealth of detail about our familial, political, professional, religious and intimate associations,\" the complaint says, adding that it \"is likely to have a chilling effect on whistle blowers and others who would otherwise contact\" the A.C.L.U. for legal assistance .The Justice Department declined to comment on the suit.In other lawsuits against national security policies, the government has often persuaded courts to dismiss them without ruling on the merits by arguing that litigation would reveal state secrets or that the plaintiffs could not prove they were personally affected and so lacked standing in court .This case may be different. The government has now declassified the existence of the program. And the A.C.L.U. is a customer of Verizon Business Network Services the recipient of a leaked secret court order for all its domestic calling records which it says gives it standing.The call logging program keeps a record of \" metadata \" from domestic phone calls, including which numbers were dialed and received, from which location, and the time and duration.The effort began as part of the Bush administration's post Sept. 11 programs of surveillance without court approval, which has continued since 2006 with the blessing of a national security court . The court has secretly ruled that bulk surveillance is authorized by a section of the Patriot Act that allows the F.B.I. to obtain \" business records \" relevant to a counterterrorism investigation. Congress never openly voted to authorize the collection of logs of hundreds of millions of domestic calls, but some lawmakers were secretly briefed. Some members of Congress have backed the program as a useful counterterrorism tool others have denounced it.\"The administration claims authority to sift through details of our private lives because the Patriot Act says that it can,\" Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr . \"I disagree. I authored the Patriot Act, and this is an abuse of that law.\"Over the weekend, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that officials may access the database only if they can meet a legal justification \" reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\" Queries are audited under the oversight of the national security court .Timothy Edgar, a former civil liberties official on intelligence matters in the Bush and Obama administrations who worked on building safeguards into the phone log program, said the notion underlying the limits was that people's privacy is not invaded by having their records collected, but only when a human examines them.\"When you have important reasons why that collection needs to take place on a scale that is much larger than case by case or individual obtaining of records,\" he said, \"then one of the ways you try to deal with the privacy issue is you think carefully about having a set of safeguards that basically say, 'O.K., yes, this has major privacy implications, but what can we do on the back end to address those?' \"Still, privacy advocates say the existence of the database will erode the sense of living in a free society whenever Americans pick up a phone, they now face the consideration of whether they want the record of that call to go into the government's files.Moreover, while use of the database is now limited to terrorism, history has shown that new government powers granted for one purpose often end up applied to others. An expanded search warrant authority justified by the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, was used far more often in routine investigations like suspected drug, fraud and tax offenses . Executive branch officials and lawmakers who support the program have hinted that some terrorist plots have been foiled by using the database. In private conversations, they have also explained that investigators start with a phone number linked to terrorism, and scrutinize the ring of people who have called that number and other people who in turn called those in an effort to identify co conspirators.Still, that analysis may generally be performed without a wholesale sweep of call records, since investigators can instead use subpoenas to obtain relevant logs from telephone companies . Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, two Democrats who have examined it in classified Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, have claimed that the evidence is thin that the program provided uniquely available intelligence .But supporters privately say the database's existence is about more than convenience and speed. They say it can also help in searching for networks of terrorists who are taking steps to shield their communications from detection by using different phones to call one another. If calls from a different number are being made from the same location as calls by the number that was already known to be suspicious, having the entire database may be helpful in a way that subpoenas for specific numbers cannot match.It remains unclear, however, whether there have been any real world instances in which a terrorist was identified in that way, or whether that advantage is to date only theoretical.A 1979 ruling over small scale collection of calling metadata held that such records were not protected by the Fourth Amendment privacy rights since people have revealed such information to phone companies . In a 2012 case involving GPS trackers, however, the Supreme Court suggested that the long term, automated collection of people's public movements might raise Fourth Amendment issues."}
{"_id": 1, "text": "WASHINGTON The Obama administration released hundreds of pages of newly declassified documents related to National Security Agency surveillance late Monday, including an 87 page ruling in which the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court first approved a program to systematically track Americans' emails during the Bush administration .\"The raw volume of the proposed collection is enormous,\" wrote Judge Colleen Kollar Kotelly, who was then the chief judge on the secret surveillance court . The government censored the date of her ruling in the publicly released document, and many sections including a description of what she had been told about terrorism threats were heavily redacted.The ruling was among a trove of documents that were declassified and made public by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, including those by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Freedom Foundation.Many of the documents have historic significance, showing how Bush administration surveillance programs that were initially conducted without court oversight and outside statutory authorization were brought under the authority of the surveillance court and subjected to oversight rules. The documents also included reports to Congress, training slides and regulations issued under President Obama .The Bush administration temporarily shut down its bulk collection of email logs after Justice Department lawyers raised legal concerns in March. Judge Kollar Kotelly declared the collection lawful in July, according to documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.The email metadata information like the identities of senders and recipients and the dates of messages, but not the content was used in searches of unknown associates of terrorism suspects . The Obama administration has said it shut down the email metadata program in 2011 for \"operational and resource \" reasons.Several other court documents released on Monday indicated that the program had difficulties with collecting Internet communications beyond the scope of what the court had authorized. Redactions made it difficult to understand the specifics of the problems, but an accompanying statement offered more details. At one point, it said, the government had shut down the program for several months \"because of the significance and complexity of these incidents.\"The New York Times reported in 2009 that the N.S.A. had intercepted private email messages and phone calls of Americans on a scale that went beyond broad legal limits. A statement released on Monday said that an excess collection problem in 2009 was the result of \"longstanding compliance issues associated with N.S.A.'s electronic communications and telephony bulk metadata collection programs\" and that the N.S.A. \"recognized that its compliance and oversight structure had not kept pace with its operational momentum.\"In a statement, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that with the new releases, nearly,000 pages about surveillance matters had been declassified since President Obama instructed him in June to \"make public as much information as possible about certain sensitive programs while being mindful of the need to protect sensitive classified intelligence activities and national security .\"\"Release of these documents reflects the executive branch's continued commitment to making information about this intelligence collection program publicly available when appropriate and consistent with the national security of the United States,\" he said.The trove also included the Bush administration's 2006 application for initial approval by the surveillance court to collect bulk logs of all domestic phone calls under a provision of the Patriot Act that allows the collection of business records deemed \"relevant\" to an investigation, another program it had previously undertaken unilaterally. The call record program is still active.\"Here, the government's interest is the most compelling imaginable the defense of the nation in wartime from attacks that may take thousands of lives,\" said the Justice Department brief, which was signed by Alberto Gonzales, who was then attorney general . \"On the other side of the ledger, the intrusion is minimal\" into privacy concerns because the calling logs did not include any content of communications.The documents show that as early as, an inspector general review recommended tighter controls over the bulk telephone metadata program to reduce the risk that they would violate the limits on the collection of data. In, the court would sharply rebuke the N.S.A. for violating its own procedures and misleading the nation's intelligence court about how it used the telephone call logs.Jameel Jaffer, a senior lawyer with the A.C.L.U., argued that the release of the documents demonstrated what he argued were structural problems with the surveillance court, which decides major issues.\"This is a reminder a lot of the most important and far reaching decisions of the past decade were issued by this court, which meets in secret and hears only from the government and doesn't publish its decisions,\" Mr. Jaffer said.The full scope and details of any revelations in the documents were not immediately clear because of the large volume of materials and the late hour at which they became available. It appeared likely to take days for journalists, privacy advocates and other close watchers of surveillance policy issues to finish scouring the trove."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON Rebecca M. Blank was a top candidate in 2011 to lead President Obama 's Council of Economic Advisers, but then the White House turned up something politically dangerous.\"A commitment to economic justice necessarily implies a commitment to the redistribution of economic resources, so that the poor and the dispossessed are more fully included in the economic system,\" Ms. Blank, a noted poverty researcher, wrote in. With advisers wary of airing those views in a nomination fight, Mr. Obama passed over Ms. Blank, then a top Commerce Department official and now the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin . Instead he chose Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist.\"Redistribution is a loaded word that conjures up all sorts of unfairness in people's minds,\" said William M. Daley, who was Mr. Obama's chief of staff at the time. Republicans wield it \"as a hammer\" against Democrats, he said, adding, \"It's a word that, in the political world, you just don't use.\"These days the word is particularly toxic at the White House, where it has been hidden away to make the Affordable Care Act more palatable to the public and less a target for Republicans, who have long accused Democrats of seeking \"socialized medicine.\" But the redistribution of wealth has always been a central feature of the law and lies at the heart of the insurance market disruptions driving political attacks this fall.\"Americans want a fair and fixed insurance market,\" said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who advised Mr. Obama's team as it designed the law. \"You cannot have that without some redistribution away from a small number of people.\"Mr. Obama's advisers set out to pass the law in 2009 fully aware that fears among middle class voters sank President Bill Clinton's health initiative 16 years earlier . So they designed the legislation to minimize the number of people likely to be hurt.Instead of a sweeping change to a government run \"single payer\" system favored by Democratic liberals, members of the administration sought to preserve the existing system of employer provided health insurance while covering the uninsured through the expansion of Medicaid and changes to the individual insurance market .They also added benefits available to any family, such as the ability of children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' health plans .But throughout the process, they knew that some level of redistributing wealth creating losers as well as winners was inescapable.They were nonetheless acutely aware of how explosive the word could be. When Mr. Obama ran for president in, Republicans tried to wound him by accusing him of waging \"class warfare\" to achieve wealth redistribution. That fall, the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, derided Mr. Obama as the \"redistributor in chief\" as he seized on Mr. Obama's comments to an Ohio man later known as \"Joe the Plumber\" that he wanted to \"spread the wealth around.\"Mr. Obama survived that episode and other instances when Republicans deployed old recordings of him using the word \"redistribution\" as evidence that he was a closet socialist. But Mr. Obama had learned a lesson.After he took office, he cast his goal of rolling back President George W . Bush's tax cuts for higher earners not as economic redistribution, but as the restoration of top end rates from the Clinton years. The Affordable Care Act was a similar semantic sidestep. The law targeted high earners, too, by raising their Medicare taxes enough to reduce their after tax incomes by nearly 2 percent, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That revenue helped finance coverage for those currently without insurance, who tend to have lower incomes and who in many cases will receive government subsidies to make their premiums cheaper.And yet for those nervous about potential changes, the president promised stability . \"If you like your current insurance, you will keep your current insurance,\" Mr. Obama said the day he signed the legislation in March, a promise he made repeatedly as the Oct. 1 opening day of the online health insurance marketplaces approached.Hiding in plain sight behind that pledge visible to health policy experts but not the general public was the redistribution required to extend health coverage to those who had been either locked out or priced out of the market .Now some of that redistribution has come clearly into view.The law, for example, banned rate discrimination against women, which insurance companies called \"gender rating\" to account for their higher health costs . But that raised the relative burden borne by men. The law also limited how much more insurers can charge older Americans, who use more health care over all. But that raised the relative burden on younger people.And the law required insurers to offer coverage to Americans with pre existing conditions, which eased costs for less healthy people but raised prices for others who had been charged lower rates because of their good health.\"The A.C.A. is very much about redistribution, whether or not its advocates acknowledge that this is the case,\" wrote Reihan Salam on the website of the conservative National Review.Having obscured much of that vulnerability before, Mr. Obama has responded to recent political heat by apologizing and expanding the scope of his discredited \"you can keep it\" promise.Mr. Gruber of M.I.T. called redistribution a convenient tool for Republican opponents who would fight the law anyway.In the end, America's political culture may have made it unrealistic to expect a smooth public reception for the law, no matter how cleverly the White House modulated Mr. Obama's language or shaped his policy to minimize the number of losers.\"The reality is, any big thing you take on, any big change, is hard to accomplish,\" said David Axelrod, the president's longtime strategist. In America, he said, \"we've created a sense that everyone can expect to win nobody has to sacrifice.\"At the same time, Mr. Axelrod argued that widening income inequality has, to some Americans at least, changed the meaning of redistribution. \"The whole redistribution argument has shifted in the country because there's a sense that a lot of redistribution has been to the top and not the bottom,\" Mr. Axelrod said.Still, the word is hardly a favorite of the president these days. The last time Mr. Obama used it in public, according to Federal News Service transcripts, was 18 months ago during his re election campaign in Elyria, Ohio .\"Understand this is not a redistribution argument,\" the president told his audience then. \"This is not about taking from rich people to give to poor people. This is about us together making investments in our country so everybody's got a fair shot.\""}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON The refusal by about half the states to expand Medicaid will leave millions of poor people ineligible for government subsidized health insurance under President Obama's health care law even as many others with higher incomes receive federal subsidies to buy insurance .Starting next month, the administration and its allies will conduct a nationwide campaign encouraging Americans to take advantage of new high quality affordable insurance options. But those options will be unavailable to some of the neediest people in states like Texas, Florida, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia, which are refusing to expand Medicaid .More than half of all people without health insurance live in states that are not planning to expand Medicaid .People in those states who have incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount,490 to,960 a year for an individual) can get federal tax credits to subsidize the purchase of private health insurance . But many people below the poverty line will be unable to get tax credits, Medicaid or other help with health insurance .Sandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner of Kansas, said she would help consumers understand their options. She said, however, that many of \"the poorest of the poor\" would fall into a gap in which no assistance is available.The Kansas Medicaid program provides no coverage for able bodied childless adults. And adults with dependent children are generally ineligible if their income exceeds 32 percent of the poverty level, Ms. Praeger said.In most cases, she said, adults with incomes from 32 percent to 100 percent of the poverty level,250 to,530 for a family of three) \"will have no assistance.\" They will see advertisements promoting new insurance options, but in most cases will not learn that they are ineligible until they apply. Administration officials said they worried that frustrated consumers might blame President Obama rather than Republicans like Gov . Rick Perry of Texas and Gov . Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who have resisted the expansion of Medicaid . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 25 million people will gain insurance under the new health care law. Researchers at the Urban Institute estimate that.7 million uninsured adults with incomes below the poverty level could also gain coverage except that they live in states that are not expanding Medicaid .In approving the health care law in, Congressional Democrats intended to expand Medicaid eligibility in every state .But the Supreme Court ruled last year that the expansion was an option for states, not a requirement. At least 25 states mainly those with Republican governors or Republican controlled legislatures have balked at expanding the program, in part because of concerns about long term costs .Several Republican governors, like Rick Scott in Florida, wanted to expand Medicaid, but met resistance from state legislators .Mr. Obama and administration officials, including Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, plan to fly around the country this summer promoting the health care law to a public largely unaware of the new insurance options.Bee Moorhead, the executive director of Texas Impact, an interfaith group that favors the expansion of coverage, said \"A lot of people will come in, file applications and find they are not eligible for help because they are too poor. We'll have to tell them, 'If only you had a little more money, you could get insurance subsidies, but because you are so poor, you cannot get anything.'\"That's an odd message, a very strange message. And if people are sick, they will be really upset.\"In Atlanta, Amanda Ptashkin, the director of outreach and advocacy at Georgians for a Healthy Future, a consumer group, said \" Hundreds of thousands of people with incomes below the poverty level would be eligible for Medicaid if the state decided to move forward with the expansion of Medicaid . As things now stand, they will not be eligible for anything. What do we do for them? What do we tell them?\"Jonathan E. Chapman, the executive director of the Louisiana Primary Care Association, which represents more than two dozen community health centers, described the situation in his state this way \"If the breadwinner in a family of four works full time at a job that pays 14 an hour and the family has no other income, he or she will be eligible for insurance subsidies . But if they make 10 an hour, they will not be eligible for anything.\""}
{"_id": 2, "text": "Slogans can get in the way of politics. A number of the combatants in the quarrel over Medicaid expansion in Texas regularly tell voters that government should be run more like a business . State officials, starting with Gov . Rick Perry, want the state to stay away from any expansion outlined in the federal Affordable Care Act . They object to creating an entitlement program where none currently exists, because they say they fear it will grow into a money gobbling monument to big government socialism, even.Besides, they say, Texas doesn't have enough doctors and other medical professionals to provide care for the newly insured.Those are political arguments. The business arguments the financial arguments go in the other direction. The state could abandon the expansion whenever it wants. In the meantime, the vast majority of the costs would be borne by the federal government . Turning away from a pot of money because it might disappear some day? Texas was built on businesses oil, gas, real estate, agriculture that ebb and flow, boom and bust .The governor is poaching jobs from other states, evangelizing in the name of economic development on behalf of Texas that's sufficiently predatory enough and potentially profitable enough to qualify in some circles as businesslike. (Yes, he might also be running for national office again, but Ann Richards, who didn't have national aspirations, made similar forays into other states .)On the other hand, the governor has been a full time government employee since.Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst is investigating what he says is a top aide's multimillion dollar embezzlement from his campaign accounts. In the political sense, it is going to be difficult for Mr. Dewhurst to argue that his prowess as a businessman and his mastery over money deserve more time on the state payroll . But the self made zillionaire obviously knows how to run a business that's how he got rich.Both Mr. Perry and Mr. Dewhurst can claim to know how the business world works, whether their recent records support it or not. But look at the capper They and others are talking seriously about walking away from a gargantuan federal freebie. The federal government is offering to pay all of the costs of expanding the Medicaid program to some of the state's uninsured population for three years, then to pay 90 percent of the costs for several years after that. Texas could, according to a report commissioned by Texas Impact, an interfaith public policy group, spend 15 billion over the next 10 years and pull down 100 billion in federal funds as a result.Here's the business question Why leave that kind of money on the table, especially if it's going to be spent elsewhere if Texas opts out?The argument for expansion is that it would take care of a lot of people for some period of time even if it doesn't take care of them forever. The choice is between insuring a crowd of people for a few or many years, or not insuring them at all. Between providing their health care in expensive and inefficient emergency rooms, or taking care of them by expanding Medicaid .It's not just a good government take care of those less fortunate thing, either. Medicaid has enough flaws to feed a dozen think tanks. But by expanding Medicaid, the state would also bring in billions of dollars to pay for health care for people who aren't insured now, providing relief to local taxpayers who wouldn't be on the hook for nearly as much uncompensated care, turbocharging the state's medical economy, and bringing federal tax dollars paid by Texans back into the state .If you don't do that last bit, by the way, the money would otherwise go to places like California, Massachusetts, New York. Where's the business sense in that? And where, because that's a transfer of wealth in some measure from red to blue states, is the political sense?It might be true that a Medicaid expansion will work only for a few years in Texas and other states they can quit if that time comes. For many officeholders, it makes political sense to opt out. But if they were running state government like a business, without the political undertow, the conversation would already be over."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON The governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, released details on Friday of his proposal to use federal Medicaid funds to buy private health insurance for low income people a plan similar to one being carried out by Arkansas and considered by other Republican governors who oppose expanding Medicaid under President Obama's health care law .Like the Arkansas plan, which the Obama administration formally approved in September, Mr. Corbett's proposal would use federal funds available for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to instead buy private coverage for an expanded Medicaid population, using the new online insurance marketplace .But Mr. Corbett's proposal veers more sharply from traditional Medicaid and thus may have a harder time winning federal approval than the Arkansas plan. Under his plan, people whose incomes are greater than 50 percent of the federal poverty level currently,415 for a household of one would have to pay a \"nominal\" monthly premium, according to a draft of Mr. Corbett's application for a federal waiver.The premium requirement would encourage beneficiaries \"to make healthier choices, both in their daily lives and when making decisions about their health care,\" according to the draft application. People could see their premiums reduced if they paid their premiums on time and got an annual physical exam.\"The idea here is to encourage people to seek preventive care and develop a relationship with a primary care provider,\" said Christine Cronkright, a spokeswoman for Mr. Corbett, adding that those who worked at least 20 hours a week on average would qualify for additional reductions.In addition, most adults ages 21 to 64 who are unemployed or work fewer than 20 hours a week would also have to search for jobs as a condition of eligibility for the insurance program .Mr. Corbett also wants to restructure Medicaid for current beneficiaries, who, under his plan, would stay in the traditional program instead of getting private coverage through the exchange . Under his plan, most working age adults in the traditional program would be enrolled in a \" low risk \" health plan with basic benefits, but people with complex health problems would qualify for a \" high risk \" plan with more benefits .Mr. Corbett announced the broad outlines of his plan in September but provided more details on Friday. In a news release, he said the plan would cover more than,000 uninsured residents \"in a fiscally sustainable manner.\" Ms. Cronkright said the state would formally submit its application early next year after holding public hearings on the proposal around the state . The president's health care law allows states to expand Medicaid to include people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. About half the states have decided to do so, with the federal government paying the entire cost through 2016 and no less than 90 percent in later years. Many states with Republican governors or Republican dominated legislatures have flatly rejected the expansion funds . Arizona, Michigan and Ohio are among the handful of states with Republican governors who are expanding the program, often despite stiff resistance from Republican legislators .Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, an advocacy group, said she was pleased that Mr. Corbett was moving to expand Medicaid but worried that his proposal would face lengthy vetting by the federal government .\"We're looking at a process of probably about a year,\" she said, \"when we could have just done what our neighbors in other states have done and expanded our traditional Medicaid program .\"As for the additional requirements that Mr. Corbett is seeking, Ms. Kraus said, \"it's kind of an administrative nightmare and added expense to require work searches and premiums for folks that really just need to be able to access health care .\""}

Mr. Chao and other administration officials are scheduled to testify Wednesday at a committee hearing on technical problems with the website, HealthCare. gov, that have frustrated millions of Americans trying to use it.In the interview, Mr. Chao said he had not seen a Sept. 3 memorandum describing potential security risks in the online insurance marketplace . The memo, from Tony Trenkle, the chief information officer at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted six security problems, two of which were described as posing high risks.Mr. Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Medicare agency, said he was surprised he had not been informed of the findings, based on tests by the Mitre Corporation, a contractor responsible for assessing the website's security controls. The controls help prevent unauthorized access and identity theft .On Sept. 27, Mr. Chao and another official sent a memo to the head of the agency recommending that the website go live on Oct. 1, even though security testing was \"only partly completed.\" At that time, he said, he was not aware of the test findings that indicated possible risks to security .In the interview, Mr. Chao said that government documents and his recollection suggested \"a failure to communicate\" within the agency, and that it was \"disturbing\" that he had not been told of the potential security risks .\"I'm surprised,\" he said when he was shown the Sept. 3 memo.The White House had no immediate comment. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has told Congress that consumers need not worry about the security of their personal information because the government runs continual security scans on the site.Jennifer Hoffman, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the oversight committee, said Mr. Issa's staff had \"basically sandbagged this witness with a document he had never seen before\" and then tried to scare the public by exaggerating its significance."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON For most Americans, Monday is the deadline to sign up for health insurance that takes effect on Jan . 1. It was supposed to be a turning point in the troubled history of the new health care law, the moment when the spotlight would shift from the federal government's online marketplace to the insurance companies providing coverage to hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of people.But as the date approaches, a series of decisions by the Obama administration to delay some of the law's most important provisions and to extend some deadlines has caused uncertainty among insurers and confusion among consumers .Already the enrollment of young adults appears to be lagging behind the expectations of federal officials and insurers . And insurers, struggling with problems caused by the chaotic debut of the federal insurance exchange in October, have criticized the administration's last minute changes, saying they could cause instability in the market .The sudden shifts have sent a mixed message to consumers about the significance of the Monday deadline. They reduce the sense of urgency but not the need for coverage . Accordingly, federal and state officials said they were prepared for an increase in activity on their websites and at telephone call centers as uninsured consumers rushed to beat the deadline.\"The Dec. 23 deadline is a huge milestone on the way to coverage that will provide relief and hope to a lot of people,\" said Andrea J. Routh, the executive director of the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance, a consumer group. \"For many, this will be the best Christmas gift they've had in a long time.\"Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the agency was adding staff, training and outreach efforts across the country. \"People tend to have questions and act when they come up against deadlines,\" she said. President Obama said Friday that \"more than one million Americans have selected new health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces \" since they opened on Oct. 1. The administration had hoped that.3 million would be signed up by the end of this month, according to a memo prepared by the Health and Human Services Department in early September. States running their own exchanges, like California, Connecticut, Kentucky and New York, said they had seen a surge in demand in the last few weeks.\"Momentum is growing,\" said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the California insurance exchange . \"Friends are telling friends. Families are telling families.\"Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the Connecticut exchange, said calls to its telephone call center had tripled in the last three weeks, to,000 a day. \"We are really bracing for Monday,\" Mr. Counihan said. The Connecticut exchange is increasing its call center staff to 114 from.The White House and health policy experts have repeatedly said the new insurance plans need to sign up large numbers of younger, healthier people to balance the financial risks of covering older Americans who require more medical care . Federal officials have not disclosed demographic data on people buying insurance through the federal exchange, but early data from states suggest that people ages 55 to 64 are overrepresented while those younger than 35 are underrepresented.In Colorado, 43 percent of people signing up for private plans in the first couple of months were in the 55 to 64 age bracket. In Connecticut, Rhode Island and Washington, the share was 40 percent. And in California and Kentucky, the proportion was 35 percent. Nationally, about 12 percent of the population is 55 to.Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that people enrolling early included some with the greatest needs people who had been locked out of the individual insurance market because of serious illnesses and those coming from federal and state programs for people with pre existing conditions. Most of those programs, known as high risk pools, are scheduled to end next year.Many people who bought insurance on their own have received notices saying their policies were being canceled or discontinued because the policies did not comply with coverage requirements of the new health care law. Those expecting high medical bills had the strongest motivation to overcome the obstacles to buying insurance on the federal exchange ."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON Just days before the Obama administration's self imposed deadline to fix the troubled federal health insurance website, officials said Monday that they were aware of another problem that has prevented thousands of people who were unable to verify their identity from shopping for health plans .Many users of the website have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of documents like driver's licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards, or sent them to the office of the federal insurance marketplace in London, Ky. Administration officials said the government had established strict procedures to verify that people applying for insurance were who they said they were, in order to prevent fraud and identity theft . But a breakdown in the process instead is causing concern among some consumers about the handling of their personal information .\"I am in no man's land,\" said Roger N. Hampton of Boca Raton, Fla., who filed an application early last month. \"I have been waiting patiently for my ID verification to come through, which has not occurred thus far. So I can't see what plans are available.\"When he tried to file his application online, Mr. Hampton received a message that said \"Your identity wasn't verified. You won't be able to submit your application for health coverage until your identity is verified. Submit documents that prove your identity. Once you upload your documents, they'll be reviewed. The results of your identity verification will be emailed to you.\"Mr. Hampton hit a button that said, \"Upload documents\" and attached copies of his Social Security card and driver's license . He said he had heard nothing back.John W. Filbin of New London, N.H., reported a similar experience. \"I have been stuck in identity proofing since early October,\" he said Monday.On Friday, the Obama administration announced that it would give people eight more days, until Dec. 23, to sign up for coverage that takes effect on Jan . 1But Mr. Filbin said \"We don't need extra time. We've been ready since Oct. 1. I have emailed and hard mailed my driver's license . We've made our way through the slow and troubled website. Is there going to be a fix for us?\"People who cannot establish their identity by answering certain questions at HealthCare. gov are instructed to call the help desk at Experian, a credit reporting agency, for \"ID proofing.\" Customer service representatives for the federal marketplace and for Experian said they had received calls from many people who were unable to verify their identity, and internal government documents show that lower level federal employees have known of a problem for weeks.Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that 90 percent of consumers were able to create accounts and complete \"identity proofing\" online .\"However,\" she said, \"some consumers whose information does not match records, such as when an alternate name is used or their address does not match, may be referred to a call center\" for identification verification, and in complicated cases they may experience \"a wait time before receiving a determination.\"Mr. Filbin said he had called Experian, but got no help because he did not have a \"reference number.\" Experian sent him back to HealthCare. gov, which has repeatedly indicated that his identity verification is \"in process.\"Jo Ann Fields of Felton, Del., appears to be lost in the same labyrinth. \"I mailed a copy of my voter registration card on Oct. 24, and I have not heard anything back,\" Ms. Fields said. \"I uploaded the voter registration card, and they said I would get an email response. I have had no response. I called the health insurance marketplace 800 318 2596 and they say to give it more time. My application is stuck in ID verification.\" Consumers said they worried that their identification papers were falling into a black hole. Ms. Fields said she imagined \"a bag of mail sitting on somebody's desk in London, Ky., with my voter registration card in it.\" Insurance agents and brokers who want to help people enroll in the federal marketplace also need to go through \"identity proofing,\" and they say they, too, have experienced difficulties.Mr. Filbin said the experience was particularly annoying because \"I am in favor of the Affordable Care Act,\" and he added \"I was an Obama supporter. I think I still am, but a little less positive.\"Experian is based in Dublin. Two spokesmen for the company, Gerry Tschopp and Michael Troncale, said they could not discuss Experian's work for the federal insurance program because of restrictions in its contract with the government . The federal website says identity verification is needed to protect consumers' personal information . Consumers are asked questions that, according to the government, only they can answer. The questions are based on information in their credit reports even though federal officials expect to receive many applications from young people and low income people with little credit history.The administration said that the website had another \"unscheduled outage\" on Monday, for about an hour. Still, administration officials said they were on track to meet their commitment that HealthCare. gov would \"work smoothly for the vast majority of users \" by Saturday."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON The Obama administration says it will require health insurance companies to report all price increases, no matter how small, to the federal government so officials can monitor the impact of the new health care law and insurers' compliance with it.Under current rules, the federal government requires insurers to report information on rate increases of 10 percent or more. New rules being issued by the administration will extend this requirement to all rate increases for all health plans sold to individuals, families and small businesses a total of 60 million people. Federal health officials said they needed the additional data to monitor trends in premiums as major provisions of the law take effect and more people buy insurance .\"The purpose of this policy is to identify patterns that could indicate market disruption, which could occur given the additional standards that apply\" to insurance starting next year, the administration said in a justification of the rules adopted by Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services .Under the new law, Ms. Sebelius said, she is supposed to \"monitor premium increases of health insurance coverage \" inside and outside the regulated state level markets known as insurance exchanges . Consumer advocates welcomed the new reporting requirements, saying they would enhance the ability of insurance regulators and the public to scrutinize rate increases . Insurers object to the requirements. The federal government \"is creating a hugely burdensome and expensive reporting system\" that duplicates what most states already require, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said.The reporting requirements generally apply to rate increases sought after the beginning of next month.A fierce debate has erupted over the impact of Mr. Obama's health care law . Insurers and employers predict that it will drive up premiums, especially for healthy people under the age of. The White House disputes that prediction and says that many factors will lead to lower prices .The law guarantees coverage for people regardless of pre existing conditions, prohibits insurers from charging women more, and limits their ability to charge higher rates to older people. Insurers now often divide consumers into groups . Premiums are often higher and rise faster for less healthy individuals and groups .By contrast, the new law requires insurers to pool the claim costs of all their customers when setting rates in the individual market in a state . Likewise, insurers must consider the claims histories of all their small business customers when setting rates for them. Premiums for each product are supposed to reflect the combined experience of all products in the market . Federal health officials said they needed to know the prices of all insurance products so they could determine whether insurers were complying with these requirements.If an insurer wants to increase rates for any product, it \"must submit a rate filing justification for all products\" in the same market, the rule says. \"Products can no longer be reviewed as completely unique,\" but must reflect the experience of the entire market .Julia T. Philips, a health actuary who works for the Minnesota insurance commissioner, called this one of the law's most important consumer protections . Minnesota has had a similar requirement for 20 years, she said, and consumers have benefited. Insurers say that policies sold under the new federal law will be more comprehensive and more expensive than what many people have now.The White House says the fears of \"rate shock\" are overblown. Consumers can move from expensive health plans to more efficient, lower cost plans, the administration says. It says critics who focus on premiums do not take account of other provisions of the law that limit how much consumers will spend out of their own pockets for health care .In addition, the administration predicts that people gaining insurance will, on average, be younger and healthier than those who already have it, and this would tend to hold down premiums . Finally, it says, even if premiums increase significantly, lower income people will be able to get federal subsidies to help defray the cost.Carmen L. Balber, the director of the Washington office of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group, said \"We applaud the administration for the new reporting requirements . This is a huge step forward .\" But she added \"There's a loophole. In 10 to 15 states, insurance commissioners have no power to reject unreasonable rate increases .\"Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said she would introduce a bill to provide the secretary of health and human services with power to deny or modify rate increases found to be excessive or unjustified."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "Eligible to Enroll David Elson is among thousands of Kentuckians who are considering their options for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act .LA GRANGE, Ky. Kelli Cauley's fingers raced over her keyboard as she asked the anxious woman at her side a series of questions. What was her income ? How many people lived in her household? Did she smoke? (\"That's the only health question it asks,\" Ms. Cauley said of the application they were completing.)The woman, a thin 61 year old who refused to give her name, citing privacy concerns, had come to the public library here to sign up for health insurance through Kentucky's new online exchange . She had a painful lump on the back of her hand and other health problems that worried her deeply, she said, but had been unable to afford insurance as a home health care worker who earns 9 an hour.Within a minute, the system checked her information and flashed its conclusion on Ms. Cauley's laptop eligible for Medicaid . The woman began to weep with relief. Without insurance, she said as she left, \"it's cheaper to die.\"Known as \" navigators \" or \"assisters,\" people like Ms. Cauley are going to work across the country, searching for the uninsured and walking them through the enrollment process. Under the Affordable Care Act, these trained, paid counselors typically work for community groups or government agencies, with a mandate to provide impartial guidance. Given the problems plaguing the federal online insurance exchange used by 36 states, the workers have become even more important in helping people understand their insurance options.But in Kentucky and some of the 13 other states that have their own exchanges, which in general are running more smoothly than the federal site, watching navigators on the job also provides the clearest view yet of how enrollment could work once the technical problems of HealthCare. gov are resolved. President Obama and proponents of the health care law have held up Kentucky in recent weeks as a model for the national enrollment effort. The state is far ahead of most of the nation in signing up people As of Nov. 1, more than,854 Kentuckians had enrolled in Medicaid under the law's expansion of that program, and,631 had signed up for private plans through the state run exchange, known as Kynect . The state says it is enrolling,000 people a day.In contrast to the federally run exchange with all its problems, Kynect has had relatively few for several reasons, Kentucky officials said. The primary contractor, Deloitte, worked closely with the state agency that runs health programs, ensuring guidance and oversight. Unlike the federal government, the state tested its online exchange early and often, so problems were addressed before the website went live. And people can check whether they qualify for Medicaid or subsidies without creating an account, a requirement that caused huge bottlenecks on the federal exchange .While most states lack enough navigators to reach all who need help, Kentucky is spending 11 million in federal money to promote its exchange, and it shows Ads for Kynect blanket television and radio, city buses and highway billboards in Louisville .\"Compared to other states, we're sitting pretty,\" said Jacquelynn Engle, who is overseeing the sign up effort at Family Health Centers, a network of seven clinics in Louisville that treats thousands of the city's uninsured. The clinics enrolled 421 people in October and helped an additional 260 start the application process . Officials in Louisville, a city of,000, have set a goal of enrolling about,000 people in Medicaid and,000 more in private plans by mid.So far, a total of,200 have signed up in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, far more than in any other county in the state .Still, the first month's tally barely starts Kentucky on the path toward enrolling the,000 uninsured residents in the state who are eligible for health coverage, a goal that Gov . Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, has said is urgent because the state has high rates for smoking and obesity, among other health problems . And if Medicaid sign ups continue to far outpace enrollments in private exchange plans, with only the sickest people buying private coverage, the cost of premiums could rise.Though people can sign up on their own, navigators can help those confused by the sea of insurance options. The navigators listen to people voice their hopes and fears about the law, and their hard stories about being uninsured. Often hugs are exchanged. Sometimes tears flow."}
{"_id": 2, "text": "WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a pair of cases on whether corporations may refuse to provide insurance coverage for contraception to their workers based on the religious beliefs of the corporations' owners.The cases present a new challenge to President Obama's health care law . The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld another part of the law, one that requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.The Obama administration has exempted many religious groups from the law's requirements for contraception coverage . But it said that commercial corporations could not rely on religious objections to opt out of compliance with the law.\"Our policy is designed to ensure that health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor,\" Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. \"The president believes that no one, including the government or for profit corporations, should be able to dictate those decisions to women.\"The lower courts are divided over whether corporations may object to generally applicable laws on religious liberty grounds.In June, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver, ruled for Hobby Lobby, a corporation owned by a family whose members have said they try to run the business on Christian principles. The company, which operates a chain of arts and crafts stores and has more than,000 full time employees of many faiths, objected to a requirement in the health care law that large employers provide their workers with comprehensive insurance coverage for contraception. Hobby Lobby told the justices that it had no problem with offering coverage for many forms of contraception, including condoms, diaphragms, sponges, several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery. But drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are another matter, and make it complicit in a form of abortion, the company said.The law presents companies with difficult choices, Hobby Lobby told the justices. Failing to offer comprehensive coverage could subject it to fines of.3 million a day, it said, while dropping insurance coverage for its employees entirely could lead to fines of 26 million a year.The Tenth Circuit ruled that Hobby Lobby was a \"person\" under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of, and that its religious beliefs had been compromised without good reason.Kyle Duncan, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents Hobby Lobby, said he was pleased that the justices had agreed to resolve the split among the federal appeals courts . \"We hope the Supreme Court will vindicate the rights of family business owners,\" he said.Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that \"the right to religious freedom belongs to individuals, not for profit institutions .\"\"These for profit companies,\" she said, \"are no more entitled to deny women insurance coverage for essential health care than they are to dictate how any of us can and cannot spend our paychecks.\"In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, ruled against the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation, which makes wood cabinets and is owned by a Mennonite family that had similar objections to the law. The Third Circuit concluded that \"for profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise.\"David Cortman, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the company and its owners, said the ruling was misguided. \"The administration has no business forcing citizens to make a choice between making a living and living free,\" he said.The Third Circuit rejected an analogy to the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United, which ruled that corporations have a First Amendment right to free speech . Though the First Amendment also protects the free exercise of religion, Judge Robert E. Cowen wrote for the majority of a divided three judge panel, \"it does not automatically follow that all clauses of the First Amendment must be interpreted identically.\"But a five judge majority of an eight judge panel of the Tenth Circuit, in the Hobby Lobby case, said that \"the First Amendment logic of Citizens United \" extended to religious freedom .\"We see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporation's political expression but not its religious expression,\" Judge Timothy M. Tymkovich wrote for the majority.A dissenting member of the court, Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe, wrote that the majority's approach was \"nothing short of a radical revision of First Amendment law.\"The cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear on Tuesday, Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, No. 13 354, and Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius, No. 13 356, are likely to be argued in March and decided by June, two years after the court's last major encounter with the health care law ."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "Border Outpost Luis Col n D az is among the thousands of Border Patrol agents who have been stationed at a growing number of military style outposts near the United States Mexico border .ALONG THE MEXICO NEW MEXICO BORDER A white pickup truck rumbled along the barbed wire fence that divides the United States and Mexico, toward a crude gate nicknamed Mingas, carved by drug smugglers to bring their loads across the border.On American soil, Daniel Algarate Mart nez, a Border Patrol agent, gripped his rifle, staring at the truck that approached on the other side of the divide. A coyote howled in the distance. The truck, loaded with logs, raced past him, past Mingas, and kept on going.\"I wonder what he has under that wood,\" Agent Algarate Mart nez mumbled.The path to the Mingas gate is a circuitous and sorry dirt trail of unpredictable dangers brought by the desert, the remoteness and the illicit drug trade . It is on the eastern edge of the Bootheel in New Mexico's southwest corner, in Hidalgo County, where the border juts down and Mexico stands briefly to America's east, one of the most remote spots in the roughly,000 miles where the countries meet.The closest Border Patrol station is about 60 miles away, an eternity in a region where most roads were cut by ranchers' tractors and cattle hooves. The closest agents are much closer these days, though, stationed for days in outposts deep in the Chihuahuan desert, so close to Mexico that the lights of its farms are the often the only noticeable sign of human life .The agents sleep in bunk beds, sharing meals in a communal kitchen next to lounges where TV sets are tuned to ESPN . Water comes from wells. Diesel tanks hold fuel for the vehicles. Dormitories, command centers and holding cells occupy modular buildings encircled by floodlights and chain link fences, a setup modeled after the military's forward operating bases in Afghanistan .Ramiro E. Cordero, a special operations supervisor for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which is responsible for 268 miles of borderland, including the Bootheel, said the bases were an essential element in the agency's quasi military strategy of \"gaining, maintaining and expanding.\" They provide a presence in isolated areas where building brick and mortar stations would have been impractical.There are two of them in New Mexico, on the eastern and western flanks of the Bootheel. Camp Ramsey, where Agent Algarate Mart nez is sometimes stationed, opened in. Camp Garza opened in November the ripple effect of a rancher's killing in Arizona, most likely by a drug smuggler.Though the number of apprehensions of illegal border crossers has continued its steady decline, the number of drug seizures has remained constant all along the American Southwest, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office, justifying the Border Patrol's expansion into such remote areas. Arizona already has five such forward operating bases, with three more to open this year.In the El Paso sector, the number of detained illegal immigrants fell to roughly,400 last year from,000 in. Agent Cordero said that half of them were captured in the Bootheel region, where, unless a migrant got lost while trying to sneak into the United States through Arizona, those who get caught are likely to be carrying bundles of marijuana.Dispassionately, Agent Algarate Mart nez, 37, who is from Zaragoza, Spain, said, \"This is dope country.\"There are four to six agents assigned to each shift at Camp Ramsey morning, swing and midnight. They each stay there for five days and five nights, and they each patrol alone, looking for signs of people where people are not expected to be. It seems like an exercise in futility agents scanning the rocky, dusty ground for human footprints amid the footprints of cows, bobcats, wild pigs and mountain lions from inside their Ford Raptors, but mostly by foot.Agent Algarate Mart nez drove to Mingas to check on sensors that had been tripped in sequence, following the type of northward pattern typically traveled by smugglers. He found no one and figured it must have been a false alarm, which is not uncommon.Dinner at Camp Ramsey that night was burgers cooked on the grill by an agent he dropped a plate of them on the communal table, and then shuffled to his bed to catch some sleep before his shift began at midnight."}

Pilots cruised in reconnaissance planes carrying radars and infrared cameras that could distinguish a migrant with a backpack from a wild animal from many miles away.Sabri Dikman, the patrol's executive officer for this region, liked what he saw and what he did not see. If any illegal migrants were trying to make their way into the United States, he said, the chances were very good that agents would find and detain them.\"We know what we're dealing with and where we are dealing with it,\" Mr. Dikman said. \"In some manner we have the capacity to observe every part of the border of Arizona .\"As Congress debates a broad overhaul of the immigration laws, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, skeptical lawmakers are asking if the Southwest border is secure enough to withstand any new wave of illegal crossings that might be spurred by a legalization program, or by new growth in the American economy . Officers who guard the line say the border is more secure in most places than they have ever known it. They say they are in a strong position to hold off an illegal surge, and to show why they point to Arizona, once the busiest and most contentious border battlefront. To the east, in Texas, agents are still struggling to stop persistent migrants in hundreds of miles of varying and penetrable terrain. But in Arizona, every available measure shows steep declines in the number of people making it across, figures that border agents say demonstrate what they can accomplish.In Congress, many Republicans recall that an amnesty in, which was supposed to solve illegal migration, was followed by an even larger unauthorized influx. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working on a proposal that would require measurable gains in border security before immigrants would be allowed to proceed onto a path to full citizenship.But to border officials here, Congress seems to be behind the times, failing to notice that they have already made many of the enforcement advances that lawmakers are seeking. Since, the number of patrol agents in the Southwest has nearly doubled, to more than,000. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, has built its air wing to more than 260 aircraft. It acquired an array of technology, including ground sensors and aerial detection devices developed by the Defense Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and created a military style command structure with expanded intelligence operations to coordinate agents on the ground.While tightening the border, officials also created a system of penalties for those who get past it, making it far more likely that migrants who were caught would be jailed, prosecuted as criminals, or expelled from the country far from the place where they tried to enter.Border officers, once a beleaguered force overwhelmed by illegal flows, have acquired a bit of swagger.\"It's all of these things coming together that have really given us the capability to bring the border to a level of security that is, in my opinion, unprecedented,\" said David V. Aguilar, the agency's commissioner, who will retire this month after 34 years on the borders. \"We haven't seen this lack of activity in, 30 years,\" he said.In Arizona in, more than,000 apprehensions were made of migrants crossing illegally, a surge that sparked a political furor in the state . Border officials declared that they would make a \"last stand\" here.Last year in Arizona, the apprehensions (an imperfect but still useful indicator of unauthorized flows) dropped to,500, a 78 percent decline from, a sharper decrease than seen elsewhere along the border. The recession in this country and drug trafficking violence in Mexico also contributed to the falloff, here and along the length of the border. But in, about half of all apprehensions in the Southwest were made in Arizona . Today, it is closer to one third, with the largest share now shifted to Texas .Mr. Dikman remembers the bad old days, when the agents' rule of thumb was to open a formal deportation only after an illegal crosser had been caught and expelled to Mexico 18 times.Now, Customs and Border Protection is adjusting its strategies to the reality of greatly reduced numbers, but more troublesome adversaries."}
{"_id": 3, "text": "HONG KONG The Boston Marathon bombings last month hit the home of some of the world's greatest universities . As the terror and violence played out in America's education and research hub, each twist and turn seemed to touch on the very campuses that draw the best and brightest from across the globe.Lu Lingzi, a graduate student at Boston University who was originally from the Chinese rust belt city of Shenyang, was one of the three victims killed by the bombs. Her death was front page news across China and drew condolences from President Xi Jinping, whose daughter had studied at Harvard.Meanwhile, the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, unknowingly played host to one of the suspects, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. With what was described as an almost eerie sense of normalcy, the student reportedly spent the day after the bombing on school grounds He worked out at a campus gym and ate at a dormitory grill.Once the two suspects began their frantic flight from the authorities, the violence extended to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where a campus police officer was shot and killed . A carjacking victim, forced to drive the suspects around, was a Chinese citizen who had moved to Boston for graduate studies at Northeastern University and had since become an entrepreneur, according to his interview with The Boston Globe . Growing concern about student safety in the United States long predates the Boston bombings . Mass school shootings like the one by a Korean American student that killed 32 at Virginia Tech in, or the massacre that left 20 children and 6 teachers dead at a Connecticut elementary school this past December have shocked the public both inside and outside the United States .David Qin, a co founder of Paladin Learning, a Shanghai company that provides counseling to students who want to study in the United States, said that parents who had children bound for Boston area universities called for advice after they heard of the bombings .\"A lot of the parents are talking to me about this kind of accident in Boston,\" Mr. Qin said. \"They are concerned about the safety level. More and more are asking about this.\"He cited previous cases that have unnerved Chinese parents, particularly a carjacking last year that resulted in the shooting deaths of two Chinese students attending the University of Southern California . In February, a Los Angeles judge dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the victims' parents, who said they were misled by claims that the university was one of the safest in the United States, The Los Angeles Times reported .\"They are concerned about the safety level of universities,\" Mr. Qin said. \"They don't want their kids to own guns. There are no gun shooting issues in Shanghai. They don't want their kids to buy guns in the future.\"The day of the Boston Marathon, before the attacks began, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the issue of student safety during a visit to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo .\"We had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to particularly from Japan to study in the United States, and one of the responses I got from our officials, from conversations with parents here, is that they're actually scared,\" Mr. Kerry told CNN . \"They think they are not safe in the United States, and so they don't come.\"\"Apart from the international recognition of qualifications, safety is the students' primary concern,\" said Adrian Mitchell, head of research for Hobsons, a London company that tracks education trends, summarizing a recent report it produced. \"If you couple this with the fact that the survey found parents to be the No. 1 influence on where a student chooses to go to university, then safety and the work that universities do to ensure international students are safe while studying holds even more weight.\"Mr. Mitchell warned that U.S. universities needed to ensure that they were perceived as being safe. Otherwise, international students might \"look towards the U.K. and even Canada and Australia as an alternative,\" he said. Education Intelligence, the research arm of the British Council, has tracked growing concern about student safety worldwide. In, students ranked \"safe country to live in\" as the 17th most important concern out of 19 categories in, safety became the 5th most important concern, according to surveys with,000 students over five years. Polled students rated Britain as the \"safest place to live in when studying overseas,\" followed by Canada and the United States .Still, U.S. schools seem to be more popular than ever. According to the Institute of International Education's Open Doors report, the number of foreign students in the United States has been on an upward trajectory for the last decade, rising from,996 in the 2001 2 academic year to hit a record high of,495 in. This increase is part of a broader trend of students crossing borders all over the world. The number of globally mobile students increased from.1 million in 2002 to.4 million in, according to Unesco.There is little statistical evidence that U.S. school shootings or other acts of violence have dented enrollment figures. If the Boston bombings have any impact on those numbers, it will not show up in statistics for at least another year.The International Student Barometer by i Graduate, an education consultancy, said that 82 percent of polled international students in the United States felt \" safe and secure .\" The survey of more than,000 students at 21 U.S. colleges and universities was performed in autumn, a few months after James Holmes, a doctoral student at the University of Colorado, shot 12 people at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater .William Lawton, director of the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, a British research group, said that security concerns were not unique to the United States .\"There is anecdotal evidence that interest in studying in Britain dipped after the London riots,\" he said, referring to violent clashes with the police in. \"There is hard evidence that attacks on Indian kids in Melbourne in 2009 or 2010 hurt recruitment from India until just this year.\""}
{"_id": 3, "text": "Nearly two thirds of Americans favor giving illegal immigrants in the country an opportunity for legal status with a path to citizenship, according to a poll published Thursday by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution . Support for an earned path to citizenship for those immigrants came from 71 percent of Democrats and also a majority, 53 percent, of Republicans, the poll found.The option that drew the least support in the poll was legal residency for illegal immigrants with no path to citizenship only 14 percent of Americans favored that approach. A larger minority, about 21 percent, said illegal immigrants should be identified by the authorities and deported.As Republicans have been searching with fresh intensity in recent weeks for a new approach to the divisive issue of immigration, the poll provides potentially heartening information to lawmakers who have urged the party to support overhaul legislation that would eventually allow illegal immigrants to become citizens.The poll is notable because of the large size of its sample. The results are based on bilingual landline and cellphone interviews between Jan. 28 and Feb. 24 with,465 adults in the continental United States . (The margin of error is plus or minus two percentage points .) The Public Religion Research Institute is a nonpartisan research organization that focuses on religion and politics. The Brookings Institution, which is also nonpartisan, conducts research on public policy issues.Majorities of all religious groups in the poll supported giving earned citizenship to immigrants in the country illegally, but support was especially strong among Hispanics, with 74 percent of Hispanic Catholics and 71 percent of Hispanic Protestants favoring that proposal.Support for the citizenship option was also strong among black Protestants, 71 percent, and Jewish Americans, with 67 percent. A majority, 56 percent, of white evangelical Protestants, the most conservative group in the poll, also favored offering citizenship to illegal immigrants after they met certain requirements.Nearly half of Americans, 45 percent, said the Republican Party had been hurt in recent elections by its positions on immigration, while only 7 percent of Americans thought the party had been helped by its views. In the presidential race last year, the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, supported a strategy of \"self deportation,\" which would have made life so difficult in the United States for illegal immigrants that they would feel forced to leave on their own.According to the poll, 64 percent of Americans disagreed with this strategy, while about one third, or 34 percent, agreed.But Republicans' stance on immigration in the 2012 elections does not appear to have hurt the party as badly among Hispanics as the voting results would suggest, after President Obama won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote .According to the poll, 39 percent of Hispanic Americans said the Republican Party's immigration positions hurt it in the elections, while 41 percent of that group said immigration did not make a difference.However, the poll reveals persistent risks for Republicans among Hispanics . Only 19 percent of Hispanic Americans polled said they trusted Republicans more than Democrats to handle immigration issues . Nearly half of Hispanic Americans say that immigration legislation should be the top priority for Mr. Obama and for Congress .The president has outlined a proposal that would require immigrants who had been in the country illegally to wait at least 13 years before they could apply to become full citizens. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working on legislation that also includes a path to earned citizenship. Under both proposals, illegal immigrants would have to pass criminal background checks, pay fines and back taxes, learn English and civics and perhaps meet other requirements before they could apply to naturalize. Republican lawmakers have been testing different approaches to legalization . Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is part of the bipartisan Senate group, has said he would offer eventual citizenship but no special or direct path to it for immigrants who have been in the country illegally . Former Gov . Jeb Bush of Florida wrote in a book published this month that he would offer legal residency for illegal immigrants, but no path to citizenship . But in recent comments, Mr. Bush said he would support a citizenship option if Republican lawmakers embraced it.The poll shows that Americans are divided over whether immigration benefits the country. A slim majority of 54 percent believes that new immigrants help strengthen the economy . But a large minority, 40 percent, said foreign newcomers are a threat to American traditions and culture.Immigration is increasingly shaping the experience of many Americans. Of those polled, 50 percent said they often came in contact with immigrants who spoke little or no English, while 61 percent said they had close friends who were born outside the United States . Younger generations of Americans are significantly more ethnically mixed than older ones, the poll found, in ways that the political parties will have to take into account. In the poll, nearly one quarter of Americans age 18 to 29 identified as Hispanic, while only a slim majority of 52 percent identified as white."}

He refers to Latino groups as \"the tribalists,\" saying they seek to impose a divisive ethnic agenda. Of his many adversaries, he says \"The illegal alien lobby never changes. It's the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party joining forces with the Chamber of Commerce, the far left and the Democrats in an effort to expand cheap labor and increase voting for the Democratic Party .\"D. A. King, who quit his job as an insurance agent a decade ago to wage a full time campaign against illegal immigration in Georgia, is one reason this state rivals Arizona for the toughest legal crackdown in the country. With his Southern manners and seersucker jackets, he works the halls of the gold domed statehouse, familiar to all, polite and uncompromising.Now, like other local activists around the country, he is looking beyond Georgia to stop the House of Representatives from following the Senate and passing legislation that would open a path to legal status for illegal immigrants .As lawmakers return to their home districts for the August recess, advocates like Mr. King are joining forces with national groups that oppose legalization and favor reduced immigration for an all out populist push.\"These local people live in the middle of these places, they know how to be effective in their districts,\" said Roy Beck, executive director of one of the largest national groups, NumbersUSA, who is now holding regular strategy calls with Mr. King and more than 50 other state advocates.The zeal of militants like Mr. King is a problem for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and other Republican leaders, who are hoping to steer their divided caucus to pass a House version of legislation to fix the broken immigration system, which could include legal status for those who lack it though probably not citizenship.Mr. King's \"respectful but firm \" message for the speaker, he said in an interview, is that \"any vote for legalization would be a matter of very great consequence for the people who voted for conservative congressmen from Georgia .\"Mr. King says his wrath grew slowly, beginning in the 1990s with a feud with Mexican neighbors who disrupted the quiet of his leafy street. In Mr. King's account, they parked fleets of run down vehicles on their lawn and at one point housed 22 people in a jerry built warren of rental rooms in the basement.He took the neighbor to court over code violations, and the conflict boiled for seven years until the family moved away.A visit in 2004 to the Southwest border convinced Mr. King that the country was facing \"what was easily described as an invasion.\" Returning to Georgia, he made common cause with the struggling father of a teenage boy killed in a car accident by a reckless driver who was an illegal immigrant . He named his organization the Dustin Inman Society, after the boy.The mistrust of Mr. Boehner among Mr. King and his allies deepened recently when the speaker rebuked an anti amnesty hero, Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, for commenting that young immigrants here illegally had \"calves the size of cantaloupes\" from running drugs across the border.Mr. King in Georgia said he sided squarely with the congressman of the same name, although he might have chosen a milder metaphor. He nonetheless spared little in his description of Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who was one of the authors of the Senate bill, calling him a \"smarmy and dishonest\" turncoat. During the Senate debate, Mr. King designed and paid for thousands of bumper stickers as well as three large billboards along a commuter highway near Atlanta .\"Help us stop RubiObama amnesty!\" one big sign read, with President Obama's name joined by his hallmark red white and blue letter to that of Senator Rubio .His billboards instructed drivers to call a senator from Georgia, Johnny Isakson. Mr. Isakson, who supported a comprehensive bill in, voted against the Senate legislation this year.In Georgia, Mr. King has not been afraid to take on many adversaries, including the farmers and growers, business organizations, labor unions and Latinos . A big shouldered former Marine, he often shows up with his own placards at rallies called by his opponents just to let them know he is watching.\"I was taught that we have an American culture to which immigrants will assimilate,\" Mr. King said. \"And I am incredibly resentful that's not what's happening anymore.\""}
{"_id": 4, "text": "Maybe lawmakers should write a legislative ethics bill that would not take effect for 50 years.That would remove their instincts for self preservation, and the fear that they are passing judgment with the voters watching on their own transgressions and those of their colleagues .Asking an active politician to write rules for how to behave in elections and in office is like asking professional athletes to outlaw the drugs, supplements, transfusions and whatnot that make them more successful competitors . Meanwhile, the reputations of honest players come into question whenever their less trustworthy colleagues break the rules. Or when they operate in ways that are legal but unethical.They know better. They know what has made them successful. They know what they can get away with. And they know what the public cares about and what it ignores. Steroids are now a big deal, but before we sounded the alarms we all wanted to see the home run records broken. Doping is serious, too, but most of the public ignored it to watch a fellow Texan win a record number of bike races.Politics has its own performance enhancing practices. It is hard to tell the straight players from those who cut corners or turn their public positions into personally profitable ones.The idea of ethics laws is that lawmakers' behavior ought to be transparent and observable at a time when that information is useful.Big changes are not required, however, to satisfy voters, who generally support reform but do not generally demand it. Except in the face of highly publicized scandals or political hazards, lawmakers don't usually tighten regulations on their own activities .They will have to talk about it before the session ends. The Texas Ethics Commission is up for review under the state's sunset law, which requires lawmakers to reauthorize state agencies every few years. It's a chance to revise the agency's rules, fiddle with its makeup, remake it, empower it or disembowel it.The must pass legislation has not yet been debated in the full House or Senate, though it will come up this week. Some suggestions made earlier in the game didn't make it into the legislation, and some of those suggestions will be back when the debates take place. For instance Gov . Rick Perry, the state's busiest retiree, wasn't known that way until he ran for president and revealed that he was legally collecting his state salary and his state retirement at the same time. He played by the rules, because state law doesn't require the disclosure, and you would have to have a head full of rocks to volunteer that sort of information to voters . That will come up again during the debates ahead.The Sunset Advisory Commission, a panel of lawmakers and citizens, recommends changes to the Legislature . That panel spiked both a modernization of the personal financial disclosures filed by lawmakers and online access to those filings.Financial disclosures are not exact, but fall in ranges. But the ranges have never been updated all you can learn about an asset worth more than,000 is that it is worth more than,000. Online posting is allowed by anyone outside the government The Texas Tribune put all of the financial disclosure documents online but not by the ethics agency itself. That will probably come up again. Lawmakers complain about being spatchcocked for trivial mistakes arguing that the words \"ethics investigation\" can be louder than the words that follow, whether those are \"for filing late\" or \"for stealing 1 million .\" They have a point, and that might change with a new sorting procedure that tries to keep violations in perspective.But the proposed legislation does not include the independent investigations office that other regulatory agencies have. Instead, complaints both large and small would continue to go to the full eight member Ethics Commission . There are no audits to compare campaign reports with bank accounts .\"This is an opportunity to make changes, and they're taking baby steps,\" said Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, a liberal advocacy group for disclosure in officeholder and campaign activities .Maybe it would be easier if they were regulating someone else."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "In hindsight, it may seem clear that Aaron Alexis, who went on a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, posed a threat long before the attack, but most mental health experts say that barring the rare few who declare their intentions, it can be extremely difficult to pick out people who are likely to commit murder.\"Couldn't someone have predicted this and intervened and saved all these lives?\" said Jeffrey W. Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University . \"I get asked this a lot when there's a horrible mass shooting and indications that the perpetrator had a mental health problem. I can tell you the common characteristics of people who engage in mass shootings It's a picture of troubled, isolated young men that matches the picture of tens of thousands of other young men who will never do this.\"Just last month, Mr. Alexis told the police in Rhode Island that he was hearing voices and was being followed by people who were bombarding him with vibrations. Three violent incidents in the past decade led to run ins with the police .For its part, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it did not have anywhere near enough clues to ring alarm bells. Mr. Alexis, 34, visited the emergency room at the V.A. Medical Center in Providence, R.I., on Aug. 23, \"complaining of insomnia,\" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. \"After a medical examination, he was given a small amount of medication to help him sleep and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider,\" the statement said.On Aug. 28, Mr. Alexis sought a medication refill at the emergency room of the V.A. Medical Center in Washington . There, he \"attributed his insomnia to his work schedule,\" the agency said in its statement. \"He was given a small refill and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider. On both occasions, Mr. Alexis was alert and oriented, and was asked by V.A. doctors if he was struggling with anxiety or depression, or had thoughts about harming himself or others, which he denied.\"According to its records, the agency said, Mr. Alexis \"never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist, and had previously either canceled or failed to show up for primary care appointments and claims evaluations examinations he had scheduled at V.A. Medical Centers .\"Even if he had kept the appointments, it is hard to say if he would have given doctors enough reasons to intervene. Research shows that psychiatrists and psychologists do not do well at predicting violence . Dr. Swanson described a study in which two groups of psychiatrists were asked to read the records of patients treated for mental health problems . One group was told that the patients had committed murders or suicides, and the doctors were asked to comb over the records and look for warning signs or red flags that might have tipped off a therapist to the imminent threat.A second group read the same records and was also asked to look for warning signs, but was not told about murders or suicides.The group that knew things had ended badly was more likely to find danger signs in the records. The second group, by and large, did not see much out of the ordinary.Still other studies, Dr. Swanson said, have found that psychiatrists are good at predicting which patients will not commit acts of violence, but poor at recognizing those who will.\"I wish I had better news,\" Dr. Swanson said.Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who does research on post traumatic stress disorder, said that tragedies might be averted if the police could immediately call in a mental health team when they encountered people like Mr. Alexis who claim to be hearing voices.\"Wouldn't it be great if there was a local outreach team that the police could call?\" Dr. Yehuda said. \"We know how to send an ambulance, but maybe we should have the equivalent of a mental health ambulance.\"Dr. Yehuda agreed that predicting violence is a tough call, but she said that certain symptoms were a warning sign, including two that Mr. Alexis apparently exhibited hearing voices and displaying uncontrollable anger. The idea that Mr. Alexis had a blackout caused by anger was especially troubling, Dr. Yehuda said."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "WASHINGTON A deputy attorney general told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that the Justice Department had begun working with Treasury officials and financial regulators to clarify how it legally deals with banks and other businesses that serve marijuana dispensaries and growers in states that have legalized the drug for medical or recreational use.The deputy attorney general, James M. Cole, said the Obama administration was dedicated to enforcing federal drug laws and was choosing the best among a number of imperfect solutions by relying on states to regulate marijuana \"from seed to sale.\"The hearing was the first aimed at sorting out differences between state and federal laws since Colorado and Washington State passed measures approving the recreational use of marijuana in November.Those laws \"underscored persistent uncertainty\" about how the Justice Department resolves conflicts between state and federal marijuana laws, said Senator Patrick J . Leahy, the committee's chairman . Financial institutions, security providers and landlords that serve marijuana businesses can be prosecuted for racketeering, money laundering and trafficking under current federal laws, which Mr. Leahy said also hinder states in regulating the banking and taxation of growers and dispensaries.But Senator Charles E . Grassley of Iowa, the panel's ranking Republican, said the Justice Department move was a step toward broad legalization of marijuana that would result in disastrous consequences for public safety and might violate international treaties . More broadly, he and other critics said, the Justice Department's new policy was another example of the Obama administration's picking which laws to enforce and which to disregard.Marijuana's status as an illegal drug \"isn't based on a whim,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"It's based on what science tells us about this dangerous and addictive drug.\"Mr. Cole responded \"We are not giving immunity. We are not giving a free pass. We are not abdicating our responsibility.\"He said the agency would go after marijuana providers who market the drug to children or who try to sell it across state lines .Advocates for marijuana legalization say a more coordinated effort between states and the federal government would be an improvement over current policies that have failed to rein in drug cartels and reduce violence .The Justice Department said last month that it would not seek to pre empt the state laws as long as states set up \"robust\" regulations to keep marijuana operations from running afoul of the agency's top enforcement priorities, like preventing children and drug cartels from obtaining the drug and prohibiting its use on federal land .But John Urquhart, who was a police officer for 37 years in Seattle before he became the sheriff of King County, Wash., said states were still handcuffed by not knowing how banks and other financial institutions could conduct marijuana related business .\"I am simply asking the federal government to allow banks to work with legitimate marijuana businesses who are licensed under state law,\" he said.Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration who opposes legalization, said the administration's decision to rely on states for regulation ignores the Justice Department's own statements that some marijuana operations had already violated its enforcement priorities.\"I just don't see any of that being regulated, and that's what I worry about,\" he said. Colorado and Washington are among the 20 states and the District of Columbia that allow the use of marijuana for medical reasons or for recreation."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "NEW ORLEANS Citing \"grotesque prosecutorial misconduct\" on the part of federal lawyers here and in Washington, a judge on Tuesday threw out the 2011 convictions of five former police officers who had been found guilty in a momentous civil rights case of killing two citizens and engaging in an extensive cover up in the days after Hurricane Katrina .In a heated 129 page decision, Judge Kurt D. Englehardt of Federal District Court here declared that federal prosecutors had created a \"prejudicial, poisonous atmosphere\" in making anonymous online comments before and during the trial at nola.com, the Web site of The Times Picayune, and ordered a new trial for all five officers .The decision represented the collapse, for now, of a case that was seen as symbolizing both the profound breakdown of law and order after the hurricane and a deep rot within the city's police department that dated back well before the storm .While a scandal over anonymous online commenting had already cut short the federal careers of two local prosecutors and the United States attorney himself, Tuesday's decision identified another, previously unknown commenter a veteran lawyer in the Department of Justice in Washington who had a role in preparing the case for trial.\"This case started as one featuring allegations of brazen abuse of authority, violation of the law and corruption of the criminal justice system,\" the decision read. \"Unfortunately though the focus has shifted from the accused to the accusers, it has continued to be about those very issues.\"The vacating of the 2011 convictions, which were hailed by the city's officials and by Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr ., was another setback for a wide ranging federal campaign to reform the New Orleans Police Department and hold some of its officers accountable for past abuse. A consent decree mandating full scale departmental changes, announced with fanfare by the city and the Justice Department last summer, is now being appealed by city officials, who said they were unaware of the costs of a separate decree being negotiated that concerns the troubled city jail.The most notorious of several criminal investigations concerned the shootings on the Danziger Bridge on Sept, 2005, when the streets were still flooded and citizens were scavenging for basic supplies. Responding to a distress call, officers raced to the bridge and, according to testimony of witnesses, opened fire without warning, leaving four badly injured and James Brisette, 17, and Ronald Madison, a mentally disabled 40 year old, dead. Trial witnesses described the cover up that followed, beginning at the scene with the arrest of Ronald's brother, Lance Madison.The case wound its way through the system, first falling apart in state court over grand jury improprieties before being taken over by federal prosecutors in. Four officers Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius, Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon were eventually convicted in connection to the shooting itself. Another, former Detective Arthur Kaufman, was convicted for his part in the cover up. Judge Englehardt, who declared a mistrial last year in the case of another officer involved in the Danziger case, had long been critical of the prosecution . At the defendants' sentencing last year, the judge, an appointee of President George W . Bush, criticized federal prosecutors for the plea deals that had been offered to cooperating witnesses, among other things.Some of these criticisms were raised in Tuesday's decision, but the main objections concerned the behavior of prosecutors online .That someone in the United States attorney's office had been anonymously commenting on nola.com was first revealed in the spring of 2012 by lawyers representing the target of a high profile corruption investigation. The revelations were the talk of New Orleans as lawyers identified a longtime assistant United States attorney, Sal Perricone, as a prolific and rather acerbic commenter under several handles. The targets of his commentary were varied and included the police department, which he called \"corrupt,\" \"ineffectual\" and \"a joke.\"Several months later, Jan Mann, the office's second highest ranking prosecutor, was also revealed to have been commenting anonymously. In the wake of this disclosure, Jim Letten, at the time the longest serving United States attorney in the country, stepped down.Neither Mr. Perricone nor Ms. Mann was a part of the federal trial prosecution team. But the defendants, citing Mr. Perricone's extensive online comments about the case, had already requested a new trial."}

And for the second time in two years, an effort to give him one has fizzled.Now family members and supporters are wondering if Mr. Murphy, who died in, has been forgotten, along with other war veterans from what has been called the greatest generation.\"I'm disappointed,\" said Nadine Murphy Lokey, 82, Mr. Murphy's only surviving sibling. \"I think they had him in the history books at one time, but they've taken him out,\" she said. If students do not learn about him \"and people don't talk about him, well, they forget.\"Mr. Murphy received at least two dozen military decorations and awards, including the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star and several Purple Hearts.The son of poor tenant farmers from Hunt County, in northeast Texas, Mr. Murphy dropped out of school as a teenager to help his family make ends meet . After the attack on Pearl Harbor in, Mr. Murphy tried to enlist in the Marines but was rejected because at about 5 feet 7 inches tall and 130 pounds, he was deemed underweight.A sister helped him alter his birth record so he could enlist at age, and in June 1942 he was inducted into the United States Army, according to published biographies.Mr. Murphy's daring exploits seem almost like a video game caricature. He is said to have killed more than 200 Nazis.One of his most heralded acts of bravery, cited when he received the Medal of Honor, occurred in January 1945 near Holtzwihr, France. Under withering attack, Mr. Murphy climbed atop a burning tank destroyer, commandeered a.50 caliber machine gun and held off an entire German infantry company as it desperately tried to take him out.Asked over a field telephone how close the Nazis were to him, he is said to have replied, \"Just hold the phone and I'll let you talk to one of the bastards.\"Mr. Murphy killed about 50 Nazis in that battle and ultimately forced the company to withdraw.An eyewitness, Pfc. Anthony Abramski, later said \"I expected to see the whole damn tank destroyer blow up under him any minute. For an hour he held off the enemy force single handed, fighting against impossible odds.\"Private Abramski called it the \"greatest display of guts and courage I have ever seen.\"After the war, Mr. Murphy became an actor and produced or starred in dozens of movies, including \"To Hell and Back, based on his best selling autobiography.Mr. Murphy was one of the first veterans to speak openly about \"battle fatigue,\" now known as post traumatic stress disorder, from which he suffered until he died in the crash of a small plane at age.Mr. Murphy had kept a foot in the military after World War II by joining the Texas Army National Guard . It was this final piece of his military career that made him eligible for the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor, an award that state lawmakers began presenting in.A drive to win home state recognition for Mr. Murphy, led by his family and fans, took off in. But that year the medal was awarded, posthumously, to Roy Cisneros, a Marine corporal, for his bravery on the battlefield in Vietnam .At the time, state law allowed only one medal to be awarded every odd numbered year while the Legislature was gathered for its regular session leading to a backlog of candidates in a state with an oversize military presence .This year, a bill allowing two people to receive the medal sailed through the Legislature . The legislation sets aside one award for actions that occurred between 1956 and the present, and another for actions before.In May, the nominating committee that decides who can receive the award chose Mr. Murphy for the award set aside for older conflicts.\"He is in a class all by himself,\" said Senator Leticia Van de Putte, Democrat of San Antonio, author of the bill creating the two award opportunities and vice chairwoman of the committee that entered Mr. Murphy's name into nomination last month. \"When you read about Audie Murphy, you're like was he human?\"But the opportunity to recognize Mr. Murphy fell through the cracks at the chaotic end of the regular session .Mr. Perry received the bill in his office on May, seven days before the Legislature adjourned. That meant there was time for Mr. Murphy to get the award, at least in theory. But that would have required Mr. Perry's immediate signature of the bill creating two awards, plus a separate legislative resolution giving the second one to Mr. Murphy.Neither action was taken.Mr. Perry's aides said he was never notified about the urgency of signing the bill, one of more than,200 he received this year. His signature came on June, more than two weeks after the session ended.\"Awarding Audie Murphy the Legislative Medal of Honor is long overdue, and the governor was proud to sign this important legislation,\" said Allison Castle, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry. \"Had we been notified about the urgency, we would have gladly expedited it.\"Mr. Murphy is sure to be a strong contender to receive the award in the 2015 session, but Ms. Lokey, who recently had stents placed in her heart, is afraid she may not be around to see Texas honor her brother.\"We don't know about tomorrow,\" said Ms. Lokey, who lives in Farmersville, a small town northeast of Dallas . \"If I'm not here, somebody else will carry on.\""}
{"_id": 4, "text": "To illustrate articles about Preston Hughes III, who was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1988 stabbing deaths of a 15 year old Houston girl and her 3 year old cousin, several bloggers published graphic crime scene photographs last November, around the time of Mr. Hughes's execution.Andy Kahan, the head of Houston's Crime Victims Assistance Office, said it was the publication of those images, which showed the bodies of the victims, that drove him to seek a change in Texas law to limit access to crime scene photos.\"Once they're plastered on an Internet Web site, there is no such thing as 'delete,' \" Mr. Kahan said. Their publication, he said, adds to the suffering of victims' families .Under Texas law, anyone can file an open records request for copies of crime scene photos after prosecution has ended. Mr. Kahan approached State Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, and asked for legislation that would restrict the release of such photos.Mr. Ellis wrote Senate Bill, which would require court approval for most requests to view or copy crime scene photos that depict a victim \"in a state of dismemberment, decapitation, or similar mutilation or that depicts the deceased person's genitalia.\" Opponents say the bill is unnecessary, arguing that obtaining such photos is already difficult.At a legislative hearing on the bill last month, Gilda Muskwinsky, whose 17 year old daughter was murdered in, said the measure would provide peace of mind for victims' families . \"It's really sad that we have to come to the Legislature and ask that it be legislated for common decency,\" she said.Stacy Allen, a lawyer for the Texas Association of Broadcasters, testified against the measure. \"This bill is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist,\" he said.Requests to release crime scene photos are granted fewer than 20 times a year, according to the Texas attorney general's office.\"There is no reason to believe that credentialed, legitimate news organizations in the state of Texas would ever publish such gruesome photos,\" Mr. Allen said. \"There is no history of that practice on behalf of those organizations in Texas .\"Mr. Ellis's staff has revised the bill, making news organizations and researchers exempt from the restrictions.\"We don't want to limit transparency where people need to get to that information,\" said Brandon Dudley, Mr. Ellis's chief of staff . \"We have enough wrongful convictions around here.\"The Motion Picture Association of America asked for more inclusive language, to maintain documentary filmmakers' access to crime scene photos. As such, in the latest revision of the bill, Mr. Ellis replaced the phrase \" news media \" with the more encompassing \"expressive works\" to include any form of entertainment with news value.After reworking the bill, members of Mr. Ellis's staff said they believed they had struck a compromise between the interests of victims and those of news organizations to help prevent the mishandling of crime scene photos in the future.\"This is an opportunity to get ahead of the game for once,\" Mr. Kahan said."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "BOSTON As the trial of the crime boss James (Whitey) Bulger continues in federal court here, a rash of violence visited his home neighborhood on Tuesday. It was a rare reminder of the terror that gripped the streets of South Boston during Mr. Bulger's reign in the 1970s and '80s although this time the neighborhood found itself petrified not by the calculated nature of many of Mr. Bulger's alleged crimes, but by a fear of the apparent randomness of the violence .The authorities say that a 24 year old woman, Amy E. Lord, was abducted near her apartment in South Boston on Tuesday morning and was stabbed to death, her body dumped in a wooded reservation in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood. Haunting surveillance photos released by the Boston Police Department show Ms. Lord, clad in brightly colored running shoes, exiting her car during the abduction in the 6 a.m. hour Tuesday, when she was forced to withdraw withdrew money from five nearby A.T.M.'s. Her car was found burning in South Boston later that morning. A cyclist discovered her body that afternoon.An hour before Ms. Lord was abducted, another woman was punched nearby. The next evening, a third woman was stabbed. The police have made no arrests in Ms. Lord's case but have called Edwin J. Alemany, 28, who is being charged in the two other assaults, a person of interest.\"I never thought anything like this would happen, not in this area,\" said Danielle Cugini, 24, standing across the street from Ms. Lord's apartment building, a can of Mace in one hand and a knife tucked into the waistband of her workout pants. She moved here a year ago, drawn by the neighborhood's growing number of young professionals . \"I was really frightened because she's the same age as me. It could have been anyone.\"It is the apparently indiscriminate nature of the killing as well as the brazenness of a daylight kidnapping on a busy thoroughfare that has unsettled many. \"That it happened in the morning was even more shocking,\" said Elise Menelick, 30, who teaches toddlers at a child care center. She was considering taking a self defense class from a nearby karate studio that is offering free instruction in light of the slaying.Hannah McCarthy, 19, a college student who grew up here, lives with her family around the corner from Ms. Lord's apartment and works in a frozen yogurt store in the same building. After news of Ms. Lord's killing spread, she said, her father, a policeman, drove her the few blocks between work and their home, and she and others here have taken to checking up on one another constantly. \"I think now there's going to be more checking in. Call me when you get to your car, text me when you get home, all that jazz,\" Ms. McCarthy said.It is a departure from the security she said she has always known here. \"I've always felt safe at home,\" Ms. McCarthy said. \"I walk everywhere, everyone knows everyone.\"But other longtime Southie residents said the killing, while tragic, serves as a reminder that the neighborhood still struggles with violence . There were five homicides in this district in, compared with two in, and there have been three so far in.\"Its just getting more aggressive,\" said Veronika Szwanke, 31, who, with her friend Diana Patterson, 32, wondered if the growing affluence of the neighborhood might have been a draw for criminals .\"These apartments here are expensive now,\" Ms. Patterson said.\"They know whoever lives in them usually has money,\" Ms. Szwanke said.Hundreds of people flocked Wednesday night to mourn Ms. Lord in her hometown of Wilbraham, Mass. She was a 2011 graduate of Bentley University who worked for a digital marketing firm in Boston's trendy South End.Mr. Alemany was supposed to appear in South Boston Municipal Court on Thursday for his arraignment on the other charges, but a psychiatrist told the court that Mr. Alemany was distraught and suicidal and the arraignment was postponed until Aug. 14."}
{"_id": 4, "text": "WASHINGTON Twice in recent years, the Supreme Court rebuked the federal appeals court in Atlanta for its rigid attitude toward filing deadlines in capital cases . The appeals court does not seem to be listening.A few days after Christmas, a divided three judge panel of the court ruled that Ronald B. Smith, a death row inmate in Alabama, could not pursue a challenge to his conviction and sentence because he had not \"properly filed\" a document by a certain deadline.As it happens, there is no dispute that the document was filed on time. But it was not \"properly filed,\" the majority said, because Mr. Smith's lawyer did not at the same time pay the 154 filing fee or file a motion to establish something also not in dispute that his client was indigent.Nor did the majority place much weight on the fact that the lawyer himself was on probation for public intoxication and was addicted to crystal methamphetamine while he was being less than punctilious. In the months that followed, the lawyer would be charged with drug possession, declare bankruptcy and commit suicide.Mr. Smith is almost surely guilty of murdering a convenience store clerk in 1994 in Huntsville, Ala. But it is not clear that he deserves to die for his crime .His jury, by a vote of seven to five, determined that the murder did not warrant the death penalty, recommending instead that Mr. Smith be sentenced to life in prison .But the Alabama capital justice system has many idiosyncrasies. One of them is that it allows judges to override such recommendations. The judge rejected the jury's recommendation and sentenced Mr. Smith to death.Only two other states, Delaware and Florida, allow such overrides . But it has been decades since anyone was sentenced to death in either state after a jury recommended a life term.Since, Alabama judges have rejected sentencing recommendations from capital juries 110 times, according to data compiled by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit law firm that represents poor people and prisoners. In 100 of those cases, judges imposed the death penalty after juries had called for a life sentence. The most recent override in the direction of death was in September.The Supreme Court considered the quality of Alabama's capital justice system in a blown deadline case last year and did not seem impressed.\"Nearly alone among the states, Alabama does not guarantee representation to indigent capital defendants in post conviction proceedings,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for a seven justice majority in Maples v. Thomas. \"On occasion, some prisoners sentenced to death receive no post conviction representation at all.\"That case involved Cory R. Maples, an Alabama death row inmate who missed a filing deadline because of a mix up in the mailroom of a prominent New York law firm, Sullivan Cromwell.Mr. Maples's lawyers had done more than neglect to attach a check to their legal papers they missed the deadline completely.They were, moreover, working at one of the most prestigious firms in the nation. \"I have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys from such a firm,\" Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr . wrote of Sullivan Cromwell in a concurrence.Now consider Mr. Smith's lawyer, C. Wade Johnson, who was battling a crippling drug addiction throughout his representation of Mr. Smith. According to a sworn statement from his legal assistant, Mr. Johnson would often turn up at the office intoxicated and sometimes had to be roused at home and taken to court appearances .By the time of the deadline at issue, in, Mr. Johnson had twice been arrested, for public intoxication and drug possession . Less than a month after the deadline, Mr. Johnson was rushed to the hospital while visiting a client in prison, leaving his dog locked in his car.In the process of freeing the dog, officials found a bag of crystal meth, which led to more drug charges . Mr. Johnson's fortunes spiraled further from there, and he took his own life in.The majority in Mr. Smith's case wrote that all of this might suffice to excuse the incomplete filing were it not for a second lawyer's involvement in the case . But that lawyer was based in Tennessee and was not authorized to practice law in Alabama . Judge Rosemary Barkett dissented, saying she did not see how the case was materially different from that of Mr. Maples or a 2010 rebuke from the Supreme Court to her court . In that second case, a Florida death row inmate named Albert Holland was given a new opportunity to argue that his lawyer's inaccessibility and incompetence had caused him to miss a deadline. In a concurrence in April in yet another blown deadline case, Judge Barkett identified the larger question that runs through these cases why is it morally permissible to blame clients for their lawyers' mistakes?The legal system generally answers by saying that lawyers are their clients' agents. The answer makes perfect sense when you are talking about sophisticated clients who choose their lawyers, supervise their work and fire them if they turn out to be incompetent or worse.But the theory turns problematic, Judge Barkett wrote, when the clients are on death row, have no role in the selection of their lawyers and have no real control over them.Allowing Mr. Smith's challenge to be heard in a federal court does not mean he would prevail. But, Judge Barkett said, he ought to be allowed to make his case . \"It is unjust and inequitable,\" she wrote, \"to require death row inmates to suffer the consequences of their attorneys' negligence.\""}

{"_id": 4, "text": "By the time he was, the boy from rural South Carolina had already had more trouble than any child should.But there was more to come. This time, it would come not from the crumbling family that failed to care for him but from a state that had pledged to be his guardian.The boy's unhappy history in state care, laid out in a recent lawsuit, highlights only some of the problems in how South Carolina cares for children who are neglected or abused. And the lawsuit comes as the state begins its own review of a system that legislators acknowledge has failed repeatedly.The boy, who is referred to in the lawsuit only as John Doe, was poor. A river of drugs and alcohol flowed through his parents' lives. They broke up not long after his birth. Other relatives who might have cared for him were either too old or could not be found.So the state took over and sent him to the Boys Home of the South, a series of aging cottages on 127 acres in an isolated part of South Carolina, near the northern Georgia border.One spring evening in, according to a lawsuit filed by his aunt and a national children's rights organization, an older boy with a history of sexually abusing other children lured him into a room in one of the cottages and raped him repeatedly.The boy told the staff, the lawsuit says, but did not receive medical treatment until he pulled a razor blade out of a pencil sharpener and tried to kill himself a week later.He is now 13 and living with an aunt, who says he is adjusting but does not talk much about the assault .\"It's a hard topic,\" said the aunt, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to protect her nephew's identity. \"We don't speak of the particulars. He's glad I am fighting for him.\"The state has already begun a legislative audit of the child protective division of the State Department of Social Services, ordered by lawmakers after reports surfaced that children in state care had been starved to death, were not getting proper medical care or, in at least one case, were placed back into a home where the child suffered more sexual abuse .\"We've had way too many dead children lately,\" said State Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, a Republican, who called for the audit along with 32 other legislators last fall.The investigation, which is in its beginning stages, will take at least six months, said Perry K. Simpson, director of the state's Legislative Audit Council.Ms. Horne is particularly troubled by a case from her district in Charleston County. Elijah Washington died when he was 2 after what investigators say was a hard punch to the stomach.In May, a 25 year old man who was staying at the boy's house was charged with homicide by child abuse . State social workers had taken the boy from his parents three days after he was born and allowed his great grandmother to care for him. But in December, the state sent him to live with his mother. Within three months, he was dead.\"The mishandling of cases is pretty rampant,\" Ms. Horne said. \"What we're finding is that some kids are being removed from homes they should not be removed from and many children are being left in homes they should not be left in.\"Also at issue is a long record of violations of federal child welfare standards and concerns over contracts with congregate care facilities like the Boys Home of the South . For years, South Carolina has institutionalized more children than other states . State officials say they have begun repairing a failing system defined by too few foster homes, overloaded social workers and inattentive leadership. The state has stopped sending children to the boys' home, which was named in the suit and now has just a handful of children. The home has reorganized under a new director, who would not comment on the case .The state also has a new director for social services who said the system for caring for children is improving rapidly.For the first time in years, the state will probably not be fined for failing to meet federal child welfare standards, said Lillian B. Koller, the director of the Department of Social Services, whom Gov . Nikki R. Haley hired from a similar post in Hawaii in.The state says it has reduced the number of children in foster care by 9 percent in the past year, and the number of children who turn 18 while still in foster care has dropped by 31 percent since. As a result of that and changes to contracts, child welfare expenses in the most recent fiscal year dropped 5 percent compared with the previous year.About 24 percent of children in state care remain in group homes or institutions . Nationally, about 15 percent of the estimated,000 children in state care are housed in such facilities.The state has also changed outdated policies that might have contributed to the rape of the boy in the group home. State investigators originally found no negligence at the time because regulations did not require the person watching over the boys to be awake during the night.\"We're getting sued. O.K., but we did something about it,\" Ms. Koller said. \"We fixed it.\"The state is trying to reduce a backlog of other cases by providing more services to strengthen families, she said. Finding adoptive families for children who have been in the system the longest has also been a priority.The state's improvement efforts have been recognized by Casey Family Programs, a national foundation based in Seattle, which in March gave Ms. Koller an award for the department's work in reducing the number of children in foster care .But the social service department is far from fixed, state legislators and other child welfare reformers say.\"Whether South Carolina is really taking a step to improve its services to children or reduce its services to children we just don't know,\" said Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children's Rights, which helped bring the suit against the state over the boy's home rape. \"Yes, the population of children in state care over all is declining, but is that to make things better for children and families or to make things cheaper for the state ?\"The suggestion that the state is reducing the number of children on the caseload to save money is simply wrong, Ms. Koller said.\"There has never been and will not be a reduction in child welfare spending,\" she said. \"C.P.S. is a sacrosanct thing. When there are cuts to be made for budgetary reasons, that is not where you cut.\""}
{"_id": 5, "text": "Awaiting a Supreme Court Ruling The New York Times asked readers how Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage might affect them. For Hampton and Michael Catlin, a binational couple, the ruling could determine where they live. WASHINGTON Within days, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a series of decisions that could transform three fundamental social institutions marriage, education and voting.The extraordinary run of blockbuster rulings due in the space of a single week will also reshape the meaning of legal equality and help define for decades to come one of the Constitution's grandest commands \"the equal protection of the laws.\"If those words require only equal treatment from the government, the rulings are likely to be a mixed bag that will delight and disappoint liberals and conservatives in equal measure. Under that approach, same sex couples who want to marry would be better off at the end of the term, while blacks and Hispanics could find it harder to get into college and to vote.But a tension runs through the cases, one based on different conceptions of equality . Some justices are committed to formal equality . Others say the Constitution requires a more dynamic kind of equality, one that takes account of the weight of history and of modern disparities.The four major cases yet to be decided concern same sex marriage, affirmative action in higher education and the fate of the Voting Rights Act of, which places special burdens on states with a history of racial discrimination .Formal equality would require that gay couples be treated just like straight couples when it comes to marriage, white students just like black students when it comes to admissions decisions and Southern states just like Northern ones when it comes to federal oversight of voting. The effect would be to help gay couples, and hurt blacks and Latinos .But such rulings \"liberal\" when it comes to gay rights, \"conservative\" when it comes to race are hard to reconcile with the historical meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, adopted in the wake of the Civil War and meant to protect the newly freed black slaves. It would be odd, said David A. Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago, for that amendment to help gays but not blacks .\"What's weird about it would be the retreat on race, which is the paradigm example of what the 14th Amendment is meant to deal with,\" he said, \"coupled with fairly aggressive action on sexual orientation .\"But actual as opposed to formal racial equality has fallen out of favor in some circles, Professor Strauss said. \"One thing that seems to be going on with these historically excluded groups,\" he said, \"is that they come to be thought of as just another interest group. Blacks seem to have crossed that line.\" Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to express that view during the argument in February in the voting rights case, Shelby County v. Holder, No. 12 96. \"Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements,\" he said, \"it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.\" Gay men and lesbians have yet to achieve formal legal equality . They are not protected against job discrimination in much of the nation, may not marry their same sex partners in most of it and do not have their marriages recognized by the federal government in any of it. The fact that they are asking for equal treatment may help their cause in the cases challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which for purposes of federal benefits defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and Proposition, the California voter initiative that banned same sex marriage there.But Chief Justice John G . Roberts Jr . suggested in March that ordinary politics would sort things out. \"As far as I can tell,\" he told a lawyer challenging the federal marriage law in United States v. Windsor, No. 12 307, \" political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case .\"In the three months since that argument, three more states have adopted same sex marriage, raising the total to, along with the District of Columbia .Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University, said the two different conceptions of equal protection are animated by different concerns. One is skeptical of government classifications based on race and similar characteristics, whatever their goals. The other tries to make sure that historically disfavored groups are not subordinated.\"Under Jim Crow,\" Professor Yoshino said, \"both horses ran in the same direction.\" Southern states enacted laws that drew formal distinctions, and those distinctions oppressed blacks .\"These days,\" Professor Yoshino said, \"the two horses are running in opposite directions .\"Consider the case of Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied admission to the University of Texas . She says the university, an arm of the state government, should not classify people on the basis of race because that violates a colorblind conception of the Constitution's equal protection clause.Defenders of the university's affirmative action program say the purpose of the classification must figure in the equal protection analysis. \"What we're really trying to do is try to make sure there aren't castes in our society, and we will try to lift up castes,\" Professor Yoshino said.A formal conception of equality helps Ms. Fisher in her case, Fisher v. University of Texas, No. 11 345. A dynamic one helps the university.Whichever side loses a major Supreme Court case is likely to say the decision was an example of judicial activism. That term can be an empty insult, but political scientists try to give it meaning. They say a court is activist when it strikes down a law as unconstitutional. There is a chance the court will be activist in that sense twice this week.It may strike down central provisions of the federal marriage law and of the Voting Rights Act . Should that happen, said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school, \"the left will be saying out of one side of its mouth, 'How dare you strike down the considered judgment of Congress in the Voting Rights Act ?' \" In the same breath, she said, liberals will add, \"But great job on DOMA.\"There is another possibility one or more of the cases could fizzle, said Walter E. Dellinger, who served as acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration and filed an influential brief in the Proposition 8 case, Hollingsworth v. Perry, No. 12 144. It argued that the failure of officials in California to appeal the judgment against them deprived the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to decide the case, and it was discussed at the argument in March.Mr. Dellinger said all four remaining blockbuster cases suffer from plausible procedural flaws that could lead to their dismissal. \"I've never heard of this before,\" he said of such an end of term possibility.An effort to harmonize all of the court's big decisions may in the end prove impossible. \"It's hard to imagine somebody happy with everything they do, except Justice Kennedy,\" Professor Strauss said, referring to the member of the court at its ideological center, Justice Anthony M . Kennedy.That may be just as well for the court's reputation. In giving something to liberals and something to conservatives, as it often does, Professor Strauss said, \"the court has avoided putting itself in a position where either side wants to declare war on them.\""}
{"_id": 5, "text": "NEW YORK When the television series \" Mad Men \" debuted in, virtually everyone it portrayed was steadily (if not thrillingly) married, children tended to grow up with their fathers, women kept to their place, and nobody was known to be gay .And then, over eight plot years, the future happens.Women rise and seek equality . Marriages are fled more easily. Children start to grow up without fathers. Grandparents step in to help single mothers . Gay people peek out of the closet, and some straights seem unfazed. Marriage and childbearing are delayed for careers. Couples cooperate in child rearing without marrying. Double income households let children slip through the cracks.For a fictional series set half a century ago, \" Mad Men \" does a remarkable job of reflecting America's present day struggles with changing family patterns. It takes care to show how progress and decay walk arm in arm, how good change can sour into bad.Alas, this nuance and complexity are virtually absent from the nonfiction realm of the national political conversation. In a period of stunning change in the structures of family life, America isn't having an honest, broad based discussion about how to cope.In part, that's because same sex marriage has consumed so much of the oxygen surrounding the issue. With the Supreme Court this past week giving a pair of victories to proponents of such marriage, it may be time to have the rest of the discussion.Of course, the conversation has also been limited because of polarization . Whether on Capitol Hill in Washington or at dinner tables from coast to coast or in the blogosphere, Americans are bitterly divided over how to talk about the changing family. Discussions on the right typically narrate a nostalgic story centered on the collapse of marriage . It used to be strong and stable, the story goes now it's threatened by gays, premarital sex, careerism, divorce, absent fatherhood and a too permissive culture. This worldview tends to see other social problems like crime and the drug war as inevitable byproducts of weak families.\"Communities, neighbors, states and nations bear large costs at the collective levels when families break down,\" W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, has said. \"Evidence suggests to us that intact, biological marriage is still the gold standard .\" Discussions on the left tend to be haunted by history. For too long, the story goes, state power has been used to sanction one type of family life, at the expense of all those who failed to conform to that standard gays, minorities, the childless, divorc s. Far better, the logic goes, to leave people to make their own choices and provide government support so that families are luxuries, not economic necessities. Where the fraying family is discussed, it tends to be presented as a consequence of other social problems like unemployment and mass incarceration rather than a cause.\"Surely a country that claims compassion and democracy as core values should reject as inadequate and misleading the marriage and fatherhood formula as a response to poverty,\" said a report published in 2008 by the liberal groups Political Research Associates and the Women of Color Resource Center. \"True compassion and democracy would respect the right of low income women to make their own decisions and provide proven pathways out of poverty as the first line of assistance.\"Starkly opposed positions may be good for think tank fund raising, but they do not a good society make. Is there a middle ground between doing too much and doing nothing? Between family conformity and family dissolution? Between nostalgia for a perfect family that's never coming back (and may never have existed) and a refusal of the idea that life is easier when you're not alone?That middle ground may be found by thinking of the family as, in effect, a huddle a way of sharing risk and joy, having others to lean on when life makes it hard to stand. It will be hard for the extremists to swallow, but it may be possible to argue, in the very same breath, that the huddles people form are inevitably growing ever more diverse and that huddling makes life easier than not.\"Is 'the family' a barbaric, premodern holdover institution, perpetuating irrational relations and inherited forms of inequality?\" Philip N. Cohen, a University of Maryland sociologist who studies the institution, writes on his blog. \"Or is it a 'haven in a heartless world,\"' he asks, \"one of the few places where people still have any loyalty to anyone but themselves? I think it's both.\"If that is so, it is worth continuing to argue, as we have been, about the appropriate forms, legally and otherwise, of huddle. But the more urgent discussion may be about the unhuddled. Gay or straight, old or young, a staggering number of Americans live isolated today. They struggle to make reliable commitments and to have reliable commitments made to them. They create children they cannot raise. They grow up with too few hours of devoted parenting.

{"_id": 5, "text": "The Minnesota House of Representatives on Thursday voted to permit same sex marriage, clearing the way to add Minnesota to a string of states that have recently made it legal for gay and lesbian couples to wed.The House, which is controlled by Democrats, approved the measure by a vote of, dividing mostly along party lines . In recent months, as the debate over same sex marriage emerged in St . Paul, a capital newly dominated by Democrats, the outcome in the House had been seen as most uncertain. State Senate leaders say that the outlook is more assured in that chamber and that they expect to approve same sex marriage next week. Gov . Mark Dayton, a Democrat, urged approval and said he would sign the bill, which would allow same sex marriages starting Aug. 1.If the measure is approved, Minnesota would become the 12th state, in addition to the District of Columbia, to permit marriages for gay and lesbian couples and the third to decide to do so, along with Delaware and Rhode Island, this month alone. Minnesota would also become the first state in the nation's middle to make such a choice through legislative action. Elsewhere in the Midwest, Iowa allows same sex marriage, but that was decided in the courts . In Illinois, which allows civil unions, State House members are considering a same sex marriage bill already approved in the State Senate .In a way, the vote here came as a remarkable shift. Just a few months ago, in November, voters had cast ballots following a hard fought campaign aimed at amending the State Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The amendment failed, and, with Democrats winning control of both legislative chambers in the same election, a renewed effort to allow same sex marriage emerged. Dueling campaigns an RV tour, rallies, leaflets and advertisements have consumed the state in recent weeks .\"This is a historic day for Minnesota,\" Representative Karen Clark, a Democrat and the bill's sponsor, said as House members debated the issue before the vote and as advocates on both sides crowded into the Capitol, chanting and cheering. \"Freedom means freedom for everyone,\" she said.The debate lasted for several hours, sometimes growing emotional and personal.\"I am not a homophobe or a Neanderthal or a hater,\" said Representative Tony Cornish, a Republican, explaining why he would vote against the measure. \"My constituents back home, the majority of them wanted me to vote that way,\" he said.In the weeks before the vote, supporters of same sex marriage said they were hoping to win support from at least a few Republicans and from Democrats who represent more rural districts, where the issue was more contested, far from the Twin Cities . In the end, four Republicans voted for same sex marriage, officials said, and two Democrats opposed it.\"Sometimes,\" said Representative Raymond Dehn, a Democrat who supported the measure, \"it gets down to doing the right thing.\" Opponents said lawmakers had misunderstood the feelings of Minnesotans, and had misinterpreted voters' rejection in November of the constitutional amendment to mean that they now wanted to legalize same sex marriage . Others said that same sex marriage remained too divisive, too much of a diversion from the fiscal issues that voters truly wanted answered in St . Paul.Representative Kelby Woodard, a Republican who voted no, warned supporters about the size and significance of marriage . \"We are redefining an institution that has been the bedrock of our society for generations,\" he said. \"We're asked to empathize with the idea that we should redefine marriage, and I'm asking you to empathize with at least half of Minnesotans who disagree with that. Think about them as well.\""}
{"_id": 5, "text": "Delaware on Tuesday became the 11th state to permit same sex marriage, the latest in a string of victories for those working to extend marital rights to gay and lesbian couples .The marriage bill passed the State Senate by a vote of 12 to 9 Tuesday afternoon .\"It's a great day in Delaware,\" said Gov . Jack Markell, a Democrat, who signed it within minutes of passage before an overjoyed crowd of activists . \"I am signing this bill now because I do not intend to make any of you wait one moment longer.\" Same sex couples will be eligible for marriage licenses on July. Delaware adopted same sex marriage just five days after a similar decision in Rhode Island and after ballot box victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington .During three hours of emotional debate before the vote Tuesday, State Senator Karen Peterson, a Democrat, said she had lived with a female partner for 24 years, and she challenged opponents of extending marriage to gay couples . \"If my happiness somehow demeans or diminishes your marriage, then you need to work on your marriage,\" she said, eliciting cheers and laughter.A Republican opponent of the bill, Senator Greg Lavelle, said before the vote, \"We won't fully understand the impact of this legislation for years to come.\" Mr. Lavelle, the minority whip, said it was \"strange\" to \"have to defend traditional marriage that we have known for thousands of years.\"In Maine, Maryland and Washington in November, same sex marriage won in state referendums for the first time. In eight other states, now including Delaware, and in the District of Columbia it has been adopted by legislatures or required by court decisions. Public opinion on the issue is shifting quickly, with polls showing that a majority of Americans support allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry.\"The momentum continues,\" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a New York based advocacy group that aided the campaign in Delaware . Gay rights groups are hopeful that same sex marriage will pass soon in Minnesota, where House members are expected to consider it this week, and in Illinois, where the Senate has approved a bill but a vote has not been scheduled in the House.Short of a sweeping decision by the Supreme Court that same sex marriage is a right, change could come more slowly in the coming years. Thirty states have adopted constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a man and a woman measures that can be reversed only with public ballots.\"We're not discouraged,\" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has helped finance opposition to same sex marriage proposals across the country.\"The states that have passed same sex marriage are deep blue liberal states,\" Mr. Brown said, arguing that his opponents usually find it easier to win in legislatures than in popular votes.Both sides are waiting for the Supreme Court to announce two decisions in June that could alter the marriage landscape.In one case, the court will decide whether the federal government should recognize same sex marriage in states where it is legal. In the other, it will decide the fate of California's Proposition, which banned same sex marriage in the state after a court had declared it a legal right."}
{"_id": 5, "text": "When the Supreme Court justices announce their decisions in two cases that could reshape marriage in America, few people will be listening more closely than Paul M. Smith, whose life and career have been entwined with the court's three decade evolution on gay rights .As a secretly gay lawyer in the 1980s, Mr. Smith watched in silent disappointment as his former boss, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., joined the majority in a 1986 case that upheld a Georgia sodomy law. Out of the closet by the early 1990s, Mr. Smith went on to successfully argue a 2003 Supreme Court case that overturned sodomy laws in more than a dozen states .It is that case, Lawrence v. Texas, that many legal experts believe laid the groundwork for the same sex marriage cases before the court today. Mr. Smith worked on one of several challenges to the law barring federal recognition of same sex marriage . He had also been asked to participate in the other case, about California's ban on same sex marriage .Beyond his professional interest, Mr. Smith, 58, has a personal stake as a gay man who married his partner in.\"I'm a member of the affected class,\" he said in an interview last week, with a note of understatement.The tall, redheaded Yale Law School graduate served as a law clerk for Justice Powell in 1980 and. He did not tell his employer about his sexual orientation . \"Very few of us thought we could come out and have a full career,\" he said.Several years later, in, Justice Powell would cast the deciding vote in Bowers v. Hardwick, the case that upheld the constitutionality of Georgia's sodomy law. Mr. Smith says his reaction was muted. The decision came at a time when, he said, \"I had pretty well walled off my gay self.\"Like many gay men of his generation, Mr. Smith married a woman (in 1983) and started a family. They divorced several years later his two sons are now in their 20s. After his clerkship with Justice Powell ended, Mr. Smith joined a law firm originally known as Onek, Klein Farr, that specialized in arguing before the Supreme Court, and racked up a string of appearances that would place him among the nation's elite litigators.By the early 1990s, he had come out but was not widely known as a gay advocate, until his work on Lawrence. The case began with an arrest in Houston of two men accused of violating the state's law against homosexual acts. The lead lawyer on the case, Ruth E. Harlow, had gotten it to the Supreme Court with the help of a team of lawyers from her group, Lambda Legal, and private firms . Then she made a difficult decision to hand off the oral argument to Mr. Smith.\"If I had argued the case I would have been seen as an activist lawyer from a special interest group,\" explained Ms. Harlow, now a partner in the law firm of Pepper Hamilton. Mr. Smith was well known to the justices and, she said, would be \"the living example of a very accomplished, openly gay man.\"By then, much had changed from the time of Bowers. On the day of oral argument, as Mr. Smith was getting ready to begin, he got word that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had voted with the majority in Bowers, had recently presented a baby gift to a clerk in a same sex relationship.\"It was unimaginable a generation before,\" said Dale Carpenter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who has written a book on the case .Mr. Smith recalled that he could not put too much stock in the gesture, but felt it offered \"a little encouragement.\"Six justices voted to overturn the Texas law, Justice O'Connor among them.In an angry dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the majority had \"largely signed on to the so called homosexual agenda.\" He cited a litany of laws that Justice Anthony M . Kennedy's majority opinion could one day help to overturn, including bans on same sex marriage . Justice Kennedy countered that the case \"does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\"Yet now, after 10 years, same sex marriage is indeed before the court . While few legal experts expect the justices to issue sweeping decisions recognizing a constitutional right to same sex marriage, neither case could have reached the Supreme Court without Mr. Smith's efforts, Mr. Carpenter insisted.\"We would not be here today if not for Lawrence v. Texas,\" he said."}
{"_id": 5, "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. Most United States Supreme Court cases, however significant, pass largely unnoticed when they are argued. But the opening of hearings over the legal definition of marriage was a cultural moment that brought America to its front porch.From small prayer vigils in San Diego to rallies in Boston, from Passover Seders to spiritual fasts, the weight of the decision that the nine justices will make was felt in thousands of communities far from Washington .Here in a state where sodomy was a felony until 2003 and where 78 percent of voters approved a constitutional ban on same sex marriage three years later, about 300 people gathered under a Confederate flag that flies at the State Capitol .Like some others in rallies across the country, they were united in a belief that the cases could lead to profound, positive changes in the way gay men and lesbians are treated under the law.Deanne Summer, 54, was one of them. She grew up here, and said she wished more of her gay friends could have shown up for the rally. They were too scared to come, she said.\"I didn't think I'd live to see this,\" she said. \"But even if they legalize it doesn't mean people will accept it.\"At the same time, others gathered to pray and march in defense of an institution that they believe should be shared only between a man and a woman.\"The views on marriage are not changing,\" said Dran Reese, the president of the Salt and Light Council, a Christian group north of San Diego that opposes same sex marriage . She was at a rally at the San Diego courthouse, praying that the Supreme Court would uphold what has been the traditional definition of marriage .\"The other side, they have a little more time and a lot more money,\" she said. \"That's an unfortunate position for us as people of faith.\"The sheer number of people who stepped forward this week to express their opinions spoke to the personal significance of the issue in a nation that has not been so publicly divided on a social matter since the court ruled on abortion 40 years ago or, perhaps, since the battle over racial civil rights before that.\"Folks are coming out either in support or opposition because this is one of the great civil rights issues of our time,\" said the Rev. Angela Yarber, pastor at Wake Forest Baptist Church in Winston Salem, N.C.On Monday night, she led a prayer service for a group of about 200 people who hope the Supreme Court rules in favor of same sex marriage .The same night, blessings were given in support of same sex marriage at a Passover Seder in Hamden, Conn. At a Chinese Baptist Church in Houston, a special call was issued, urging the court to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition, which limit marriage to a union between a man and a woman.The topic dominated social media platforms from the moment people woke up Tuesday.\"Good marriage equality morning!\" a New York lawyer who uses \"amaeryllis\" as her Twitter name greeted her nearly,000 followers .\"Please remember to pray today as SCOTUS deliberates these very important marriage cases,\" read the first Twitter message of the day from the North Carolina Values Coalition.Holy Covenant United Methodist Church in Chicago, a small congregation where vegetarian dinners for the homeless are a weekly event, organized a virtual vigil. People were encouraged to take a moment at noon Tuesday to pray for \"a pivotal opportunity for far reaching, lasting change for L.G.B.T.Q. people and their partners.\"Late Tuesday afternoon, a knot of mellow demonstrators with signs and rainbow flags ruffling in the warm breeze gathered on the steps of the California state office complex in San Francisco . As sea gulls called overhead, they played a mix of songs with lyrics that included, \"Don't tell me who to kiss.\"\"This is our time,\" said Breana Hansen, 27, a graduate student in international and multicultural education . \"We want to show the Supreme Court all the people who are going to be affected if they uphold Propostion. We're being heard.\"Billy Ray Bradford, who organized the demonstration, said \"Our lives are in the hands of nine people in Washington . They hold our relationships, our families and future. They get to make the call on whether our Constitution means what it says, equal protection under the law.\"A number of those at the vigil said they were not happy about comments made in court Tuesday by Justice Antonin Scalia, who asked, \"When did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage ?\" Kirk Linn DeGrassi, a dog walker, answered, \"The right for marriage equality became a civil right when we signed the Constitution.\""}
{"_id": 5, "text": "ATLANTA Here at the nation's largest gathering of politically minded gays and lesbians, President Obama's historic inclusion of sexual orientation in his inauguration speech just days earlier would seem to be cause for celebration.And it was, sort of. But as nearly,300 people gathered for the annual National Gay and Lesbian Task Force conference, the congratulatory mood was tempered by notes of caution and assurances that gay leaders would continue to pressure the White House to do more, including offering job protection to gays and lesbians who work for the federal government and weighing in on two pending Supreme Court cases regarding same sex marriage .\"People see it as an opening, but I don't know that people see it as a promise or a guarantee,\" said Paulina Helm Hernandez, a co director of Southerners on New Ground, an advocacy group dedicated to social issues in the South . \"The question is, now what do we do with the president's attention?\"Mr. Obama on Friday offered a minute and a half recorded message of congratulations to the task force, eliciting cheers and applause from conference attendees, including people who came of age before the modern gay rights movement began in, 26 gay activists from China and Taiwan, and transgender teenagers grateful that the Atlanta Hilton Hotel had created special unisex bathrooms for the event.In his message, which Mr. Obama recorded before he delivered his inauguration speech on Monday, he reiterated his dedication to the cause of gay rights .\"Today you are helping lead the way to a future where everyone is treated with dignity and respect,\" the president said. \"The work will be hard, the road will be long, but I'm more confident than ever that we will reach a better future as long as Americans like you keep reaching for justice and all of us keep marching together.\"Rea Carey, the group's executive director, then took the stage and gave what was billed as a \" state of the movement\" address in which she cautioned advocates not to rest.\"Some days I wake up astonished at the pace of our progress, but I also wake up angry about the lack of basic, basic protections for L.G.B.T. people,\" she said, referring to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender . \"I think about how, as we are in the spotlight for our progress on marriage, it can be more challenging to draw attention to the many other issues that affect our lives.\"Ms. Carey urged the group to keep pressuring the administration on a number of issues, including immigration reform, expanding benefits to same sex partners of military personnel and allowing transgendered people to serve openly in the military .She also called for Mr. Obama to sign an executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity at companies with government contracts .The Obama administration has said it would wait for Congress to pass broader legislation to prevent workplace bias. The administration has also indicated it would not weigh in on two pending Supreme Court cases challenging the constitutionality of laws that define marriage as being solely between a man and a woman. Putting pressure on the White House is not new for the group, which was founded in 1973 in New York and whose primary focus is legislative change and grass roots organizing.In, the task force helped arrange a meeting between President Jimmy Carter's staff and several members of gay organizations in what is widely considered to be the first official discussion of gay rights in the White House .This week, Mr. Obama's open support engendered sharp criticism from groups like the American Family Association and the National Organization for Marriage .In commenting on the broad arc in the president's inaugural speech that linked the women's movement, the civil rights movement and the gay rights movement, Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council said in an interview on CNN that \"the irony is that homosexuals already have all the same civil rights as anyone else.\"Bryan Fischer, a Christian conservative radio host and policy analyst for the American Family Association said this week that \" homosexuals do not have a constitutional right to engage in sodomy.\"Such comments have underscored for some here that although national opinion on gay rights is becoming more favorable, the cultural war remains very much alive.Barbara Cook, 21, a college student from Baltimore, said the fact that that war must still be fought means pressure on the president must continue.\"I just hope he fulfills everything that he said he would,\" she said."}
{"_id": 5, "text": "A Louisiana sheriff has apologized for the arrests of as many as a dozen or more men in recent years on charges that they violated an anti sodomy statute that has been ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court .On Saturday, The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge reported that a community policing unit of the East Baton Rouge sheriff's office had been arresting men who discussed or agreed to meet privately to have consensual sex with undercover officers . Some of the arrests went as far back as 2011 and some were as recent as this month.The men were arrested on charges of violating a Louisiana statute barring \"unnatural carnal copulation,\" though the Supreme Court in 2003 declared such laws unconstitutional invasions of privacy. The attorney general of Louisiana at the time issued a statement saying the state's anti sodomy law \"would be unenforceable.\"In each of the known cases in Baton Rouge, the district attorney's office declined to prosecute, citing a lack of evidence that a crime, like prostitution, had taken place. Gay rights advocates and at least one public official have publicly questioned why sheriff's deputies continued to make such arrests when the district attorney's office had made it clear that such actions were not criminal.\"We need to find out when the sheriff was first informed that the D.A.'s office would not prosecute people under this anti sodomy law because it's unconstitutional,\" said John Delgado, a Baton Rouge city councilman .Hillar C. Moore III, the district attorney for East Baton Rouge parish, said he was not aware of the arrests until informed last week by a reporter. But in looking back over the past two and a half years, he found that prosecutors in his office had been referred to such cases 9 or 10 times and the cases were dropped when no evidence was found that money was involved.Mr. Moore said such arrests were scattered and may have gone unnoticed among the,000 cases the office handles each year. \"Had it come to our attention and there seemed to be a pattern here I can see how it would have gone up the chain,\" he said.On Monday, Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III issued a statement apologizing \"to anyone that was unintentionally harmed or offended by the actions of our investigations.\" The sheriff said that he had instructed his employees to no longer use \"this unconstitutional law,\" and that he was conducting \"a comprehensive evaluation of undercover operations made by our deputies and will make changes to ensure better supervision, training and guidance.\"Bruce Parker, who manages a statewide coalition of gay and lesbian advocacy groups called Equality Louisiana, said that there had been at least 12 arrests in recent years under the anti sodomy statute but he suspected there may have been more.\"It was really a case of targeting people,\" Mr. Parker said.Mr. Parker said the sheriff's office has been responsive since the weekend, saying it would work with the Capital City Alliance, a Baton Rouge based group that is part of the coalition. While Mr. Delgado said those arrested had a strong case for a civil suit, Mr. Parker said some of them were not openly gay when they were arrested and were unlikely to want further publicity.\"Many of their lives were dramatically ruined because of this,\" he said."}
{"_id": 5, "text": "Overcoming years of resistance, Rhode Island on Thursday became the 10th state in the country and the last in New England to approve same sex marriage . The measure passed a final vote in the legislature in the afternoon. Just before 7 p.m., Gov . Lincoln Chafee, an independent who had long advocated for its passage, signed it into law in a jubilant ceremony on the steps of the Statehouse in Providence, where hundreds of people, including many state and local officials, joined the celebration.\"I know that you have been waiting for this day to come,\" Mr. Chafee said at the celebration. \"I know that you have loved ones who dreamed this would happen and did not live to see it. But I am proud to say that now, at long last, you are free to marry the person you love.\" Same sex unions will be legal in the state starting Aug. 1.\"It is an incredibly historic day for Rhode Island and the country,\" said Julia Harvey, a Brown University student who is gay .Approval in Rhode Island followed a 16 year struggle in the heavily Roman Catholic state, with intense opposition from clerics and many Republicans . But in a sign of the changing times, all five Republicans in the 38 member State Senate supported the measure the only time in any state where the entire caucus of either party has approved such a measure unanimously making Rhode Island the latest indication of growing acceptance of same sex marriage across the country. Delaware is likely to be next, perhaps as soon as next week. Illinois and Minnesota are also on track for passage . Governor Chafee has long maintained that legalizing same sex unions is not only fair, but good for business because it would help the state attract young people, who support gay marriage overwhelmingly.\"The talented workers who are driving the new economy young, educated and forward looking want to live in a place that reflects their values,\" he wrote this week in an Op Ed article in The New York Times . Supporters have been introducing same sex marriage bills in Rhode Island since, but none had been voted out of committee until this year. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly in January, in large part because the speaker, Gordon D. Fox, is openly gay .The higher hurdle was in the State Senate . But with an intense broad based advocacy campaign that included the governor, business leaders and religious leaders, the Senate considered the measure for the first time. It modified the House version by expanding religious protections for those who do not approve of same sex marriage, and then passed it last week.The measure went back to the House, where its final passage on Thursday was a foregone conclusion. On the final vote, the standing room only crowd of observers burst into song, with \"My Country 'Tis of Thee.\"During the day, Thomas J. Tobin, the bishop of Providence, said in a pastoral letter that he was \"profoundly disappointed\" that Rhode Island was likely to legalize same sex marriage and warned Catholics to think carefully before attending any gay or lesbian weddings.\" Catholics should examine their consciences very carefully before deciding whether or not to endorse same sex relationships or attend same sex ceremonies, realizing that to do so might harm their relationship with God and cause significant scandal to others,\" Bishop Tobin wrote.Other opponents said they did not see Rhode Island's action as part of any groundswell.\"I don't see momentum for redefining marriage,\" said Christopher Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Marriage, who noted that 30 states have constitutional provisions limiting marriage to a man and a woman.\" Rhode Island is not that big a deal,\" he said. \"It's a deep blue state and one of the least religious in the union, despite its high Catholic population.\"But for the crowd at the ceremony, it was a very big deal indeed. Chase Bolling, 26, who had worked on behalf of the new law, said he was inspired to do so because his older brother is gay .\"My homophobia ruined our relationship,\" he said. \"And when I found out my brother had AIDS, I promised him I'd do everything I could to make sure he had the same rights I had.\""}
{"_id": 5, "text": "The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus sang \"Give 'Em Hope\" for a revered and in some ways surprising guest who shared a California stage with them last month Justice Anthony M . Kennedy. Justice Kennedy was in San Francisco for an American Bar Association meeting, but he was also there to be celebrated by the men on the risers behind him. In remarks from the stage, San Francisco's mayor, Edwin M. Lee, thanked the justice \"for upholding the Constitution and justice for all\" in his majority opinion in June in United States v. Windsor, a major gay rights victory.\"Freedom is always a work in progress,\" Justice Kennedy said in his own remarks, making clear that there was more work to be done. Justice Kennedy has emerged as the most important judicial champion of gay rights in the nation's history, having written three landmark opinions on the subject, including this summer's Windsor decision, which overturned a ban on federal benefits for married same sex couples . Those rulings collectively represent a new chapter in the nation's civil rights law, and they have cemented his legacy as a hero to the gay rights movement .\"He is the towering giant in the jurisprudence of freedom and equality for gay people,\" said Evan Wolfson, the president of Freedom to Marry and one of the architects of the political and legal push for same sex marriage .That push has taken on momentum thanks to the Windsor decision, which gay rights groups are citing in challenges to state bans on same sex marriage . On Thursday, the Internal Revenue Service said it would implement the Windsor ruling by recognizing the unions of all lawfully married same sex couples, including those living in states that do not allow same sex marriage .On Saturday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Windsor, became the first member of the court to officiate at a same sex wedding.The praise now being showered on Justice Kennedy by gay rights advocates and the deep disappointment of conservatives would have been hard to imagine when President Ronald Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court in. Gay rights groups were more than a little wary then.On the federal appeals court in California, where Justice Kennedy had served for 13 years, he heard five cases concerning gay rights . He voted against the gay rights claim every time.\"I have to say that Kennedy seems rather obtuse on important gay issues and must be counted as a likely vote against us on most matters likely to come before the Supreme Court,\" Arthur S. Leonard, an authority on gay rights at New York Law School, wrote in The New York Native, a newspaper that focused on gay issues.The justice's trajectory since then has been a product of overlapping factors, associates and observers say. His Supreme Court jurisprudence is characterized by an expansive commitment to individual liberty. He believes that American courts should consider international norms, and foreign courts have expanded gay rights . His politics, reflecting his background as a Sacramento lawyer and lobbyist, tend toward fiscal conservatism and moderate social views. And he has long had gay friends.Michael C. Dorf, a law professor at Cornell who served as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy, said the key to understanding his former boss was the culture of his home state .\"The way to think about his instincts is that he is fundamentally a California Republican,\" Professor Dorf said. \"It's not surprising that a California Republican in 1987 would be expected to be at best an unreliable ally for gay rights groups .\"In the 1980s, California Republicans, like most Americans, had deep reservations about the notion of gay equality . But there were also early stirrings of the gay rights movement in California . Harvey Milk, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and one of the first openly gay elected officials, delivered a landmark gay rights speech in 1978 (on which the song \"Give 'Em Hope\" was based. Mr. Milk was assassinated later that year.The same year, Reagan, a former California governor preparing to run for president, helped defeat a ballot initiative that would have made it easy to fire gay teachers.Over time, some leading California Republicans moved more on the issue than many Republicans elsewhere. Theodore B. Olson, a Northern Californian who served as the United States solicitor general under President George W . Bush, helped lead the fight to overturn Proposition, the state's ban on same sex marriage . Justice Kennedy's three major gay rights decisions are in this tradition, Professor Dorf said. They also hark back to a third California Republican, Chief Justice Earl Warren, another former governor, who wrote Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision barring segregation in public schools .Romer v. Evans, in, struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment that had banned laws protecting gay men and lesbians . Lawrence v. Texas, in, struck down laws making gay sex a crime . And in June, Justice Kennedy wrote the Windsor decision.In, gay rights advocates could see little of this coming. Jeffrey Levi, then the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, testified against Justice Kennedy at his confirmation hearings, saying that \"his past opinions offer little hope to gays and lesbians challenging adverse treatment in the courts .\"Professor Levi, who now teaches health policy at George Washington University, said in an e mail that \"there was no way to predict that Justice Kennedy would 'evolve' as he did (given prior opinions on gays in the military, immigration and federal employment .\"Professor Levi drew a comparison to Dr. C. Everett Koop, whose nomination as surgeon general under Reagan was opposed by gay rights groups based on hostile statements he had made.\"He turned out to be a hero of the early fight against AIDS,\" Professor Levi said of Dr. Koop."}
{"_id": 6, "text": "In the months after his father's murder in early, those months stretching formlessly between the mourning ritual of shiva and the impending trial of a suspect, Rabbi Joel Mosbacher received many messages of solace. There was one type, however, that tested every atom of clerical forbearance he possessed.\"People said in this trying to be helpful way, 'This will make you a better rabbi,' \" Rabbi Mosbacher, 43, recalled. \"And nothing made me angrier. I didn't want to be a better rabbi. I wanted my dad back.\"He wanted Lester Mosbacher, who had been shot dead in a petty robbery at his small business on Chicago's South Side the day before he turned. He wanted the father who cheered the White Sox and gardened in the backyard and barbecued with a flashlight or umbrella if necessary. He wanted the grandfather for his firstborn son, just 11 months old at the time of the murder.As Joel Mosbacher raised his own family and advanced in his rabbinical career, moving from an assistant's position outside Atlanta to a senior one in this New Jersey suburb, he recognized that no prayer, no fast, no act of religious charity could give him what he wanted.Yet on a Sunday afternoon this month, Rabbi Mosbacher stood before an assembly of 200 clergy members, congregants, politicians and police officials in a North Jersey church to tell, in the cause of gun control, the story of his father's murder.\"All he did was drive to work, as he had done for 35 years, and he was stolen from his brothers, wife, his children and grandchildren,\" Rabbi Mosbacher said. \"I've carried this story with me, this anger, every day for the last 14 years.\" Then he made reference to a verse from Leviticus \"I won't stand idly by my father's blood.\"What Rabbi Mosbacher was proposing was not just support for the gun control legislation then pending in the Senate . In fact, rather presciently, he warned the audience not to \"hope for the best from the most dysfunctional institution in America.\"Specifically, as a leader of the faith based coalition New Jersey Together, he was propounding its proposal that local mayors, gun retailers, firearms manufacturers and large buyers like the military sign a \"covenant\" of gun overhaul measures. Among its 30 points, the covenant called for voluntary limits on selling certain types of weapons and large capacity magazines, sale of guns only through federally licensed dealers and mandatory safety classes for buyers . (Because the covenant was just announced on April, the process of getting signatures has not begun.)Rabbi Mosbacher had delivered a similar speech for a similar purpose in February in Chicago before 500 members of United Power, a sister organization of New Jersey Together, under the rubric of the national Industrial Areas Foundation. He had delivered it to a similar group in Westchester County . He had delivered it from his own pulpit at Beth Haverim Shir Shalom in Mahwah on Super Bowl Sunday.While the rabbi had done a bit of tentative speaking on gun control as early as, his commitment accelerated after, when he first learned about the Industrial Areas Foundation. As a legacy of the renowned community organizer Saul Alinsky, the foundation largely mobilizes religious congregations . Its style, far from being earnest, is proudly combative.One of the foundation's major principles is that anger, if channeled correctly, is welcome, for it derives from the Norse word angr, which can mean sorrow or grief at the condition of the world.\"It went past my brain right to my heart,\" Rabbi Mosbacher said of the exegesis of angr. \"It felt like the closest thing to me to a revelation.\"The lesson on angr also evoked the prophetic tradition within Judaism. Rabbi Mosbacher heard in angr echoes of Micah's admonition to \"to do justly, and to love mercy,\" as well as Deuteronomy's command that \" Justice, justice shalt thou follow.\"Then, in the past year, the rabbi's prophetic summons arrived in grisly form 12 people shot dead at a Colorado movie theater last July, 6 worshipers shot dead at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin the next month, 20 schoolchildren and 6 educators shot dead in Newtown, Conn., in December.\"The piling of murder upon murder and funeral upon funeral made me wonder if this is the moment when the people of this country, people of faith, would wake up,\" Rabbi Mosbacher said. \"And I felt that I brought with me more than suburban guilt to the work of doing justice in this country. I brought a story, even if I didn't tell it at first.\"In those 14 years since Lester Mosbacher was killed, Joel Mosbacher has learned there is no such thing as closure. A young man was convicted of the murder, but then his conviction was overturned. Then, this week, what appeared to be the best chance in decades of enacting gun control legislation ended in the same old futility. Yet his father's death had made Joel Mosbacher, if not a better rabbi, a rabbi with a moral cause.The Torah portion for this Sabbath, April, includes Leviticus 16, the verse about not standing idly by \"while your neighbor's blood is shed.\" Mr. Mosbacher, writing an e mail several hours after the Senate vote on April 17 tied it to another part of biblical text.\"In the book of Numbers,\" he wrote, \"Moses sends out 12 spies to scout out the Promised Land 10 come back and report that there are giants in the land who cannot be conquered. Two spies Joshua and Caleb acknowledge the challenge, but encourage the Israelites to move forward.\" And moving forward with the gun control covenant, he continued, would help America become a land \"that flows with more milk and honey than blood.\""}

Her daughter brought her M P rifle her son in law carried his.308 caliber Remington R and her 8 year old grandson, Sebastian Gonzalez, had his Ruger 10 22 rifle.\"A rifle on our back is part of our everyday life, just like a cellphone is part of our everyday life,\" said Ms. Pena, 48, who manages her husband's dental practice in South Texas .Here in the heart of the seventh largest city in the country on Saturday, hundreds of gun owners like Ms. Pena and her family carried their firearms in the open outside the entrance to the Alamo as part of a gun rights rally that was peaceful but loud.For tourists, it was a startling sight men, women and children openly carrying loaded and unloaded shotguns, hunting rifles, AR 15s and AK 47s as if they were purses or backpacks. A young man in jeans ate a breakfast sandwich with his assault rifle resting behind his back. A rally speaker with his own assault rifle confronted and quizzed police officials about their views of the Second Amendment, and the officials calmly looked on.Fathers and sons, husbands and wives, teenagers and retirees all had their guns out, as visitors to San Antonio came and went from the Alamo. Police officers monitored and filmed the rally from a building across the street. Demonstrators were exercising a little known privilege of Texas gun culture Texas law allows people to walk down the street with an assault rifle, shotgun or other type of long gun. A state issued license is required to carry a concealed handgun.Gun advocates in Texas have started using their right to carry rifles publicly as part of a push to expand handgun laws. They want Texas to join several states that have allowed people licensed to carry concealed firearms to wear their weapons on their hips, unconcealed, if they wish.Rally organizers and participants said they wanted to remind San Antonio that the carrying of rifles was not only legal but normal, and that the carrying of unconcealed weapons in public was no cause for alarm. But at the request of organizers, most at the rally stuck plastic straws or strips into the chambers of their rifles to show that though there might be bullets in the clip, there were none in the chamber .Ms. Pena and her family, including Sebastian, had straws sticking out of their weapons .Scott Gibbons had a pen in the chamber of his AR 15 rifle, which was strapped across his back as he stood next to his wife, Mandy. \"Our children have been shooting guns since they were 8 and, and they're now 28 and,\" Ms. Gibbons said. \"We want our grandchildren to also have that right.\"A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America held an opposing rally nearby, and a San Antonio man walked through the crowd with a sign reading, \"The rule of the gun will kill everyone,\" angering many gun owners . There was a tense though civil tone throughout.\"Look at here, we've got a stroller going by here, with kids running around,\" said Jerry Patterson, the state's land commissioner . Mr. Patterson, whose office oversees the Alamo, was one of several speakers at the rally.\"The 190 folks that died here were defending their right to bear arms,\" he said. \"It's specifically mentioned in the Texas Declaration of Independence of March, 1836.\" San Antonio's police chief, William McManus, said his goal was to allow rally participants to exercise their constitutional rights, though his officers were on the lookout for violations . A local ordinance prohibits anyone other than a law enforcement official from carrying a loaded rifle or shotgun on any public street in the city. And a state law prohibits carrying a firearm in a public place in a manner calculated to cause alarm.Chief McManus said he was not suspending the enforcement of any ordinances, and rifle owners at the rally walked a fine legal line as a result. It was unclear, for instance, whether some who carried rifles with a loaded magazine but an empty chamber were violating the local ordinance. Gun owners said the ordinance was unlawful regardless, because of a state law that prohibits municipalities from regulating firearms.Near the end of the rally, Chief McManus said there had been no arrests. \"Everything's been running pretty smoothly,\" he said. \"I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive.\""}
{"_id": 6, "text": "CHICKAMAUGA, Ga. Deanne Westbrook had tried everything to keep her husband, Ronald, in the house.He was. Alzheimer's had erased much of his talent for music and flying airplanes.No one is sure how, in the frigid hours before dawn last Wednesday in this small north Georgia community near the Tennessee border, Mr. Westbrook ended up nearly three miles from home with a handful of other people's mail, jiggling Joe Hendrix's doorknob.Mr. Hendrix, 34, stepped onto his porch with a Glock pistol in his hand and his fianc e inside on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. He fired four shots. One hit Mr. Westbrook in the chest.On a cold and damp day Tuesday, Mrs. Westbrook buried her husband of 51 years, his death adding another chapter to the debate over the nation's patchwork of self defense laws.\"I understand the man who shot him is real upset, and I think he should be,\" Mrs. Westbrook said in an interview. \"He shot an innocent man. He should have stayed in the house like a normal person would.\" Investigators and a district attorney are weighing whether to charge Mr. Hendrix, a decision that exposes the challenge of balancing the right to use deadly force to defend oneself with the imperfect reality of snap decisions.Unlike a case last month in Michigan when a white man shot a young black woman on his porch and the closely followed case of Trayvon Martin in Florida last year, this one had no racial overtones. Both men were white.The legal issue revolves around the question of how scared was Mr. Hendrix a young man who had just moved into the quiet neighborhood with his fianc e in those early hours.According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Sheriff Steve Wilson of Walker County, a sheriff's deputy first encountered Mr. Westbrook about 30 a.m. the day he died.In the confusion that comes from Alzheimer's, Mr. Westbrook had taken to collecting the mail from neighbors' mailboxes. He was doing so that night on Marbletop Road, which is a mile or so from his home. He told the deputy he lived in a nearby house, which at one time, years ago, he had.\"Better get home,\" the deputy said. \"It's cold.\"The deputy drove on, and Mr. Westbrook, in a straw hat and a jacket too light for the weather, continued walking with his dogs.Just before 4 a.m., he was nearly three miles from home in the subdivision of modest new houses where Mr. Hendrix lives, near Chattanooga.Mr. Hendrix, a veteran of the Iraq war who last year served as the spokesman for a Republican candidate for Congress from Tennessee, Scottie Mayfield, did not return calls seeking an interview.At least twice, Mr. Westbrook climbed onto the small porch, tried to open the door and rang the doorbell, Sheriff Wilson said. Dogs were barking. The police were called.The sheriff and Mr. Westbrook had played together in their church's orchestra. Mr. Westbrook had been a skilled trumpet player, retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel .Sheriff Wilson said he wished Mr. Hendrix had just stayed inside. But he knows it was a tense situation.\"When you listen to the 911 calls, it's evident to me that there was fear displayed at least by the female who lived there,\" he said.As Mr. Westbrook came around a corner of the house, Mr. Hendrix took his gun and repeatedly called for him to identify himself, he told the police . Then he fired the shots . Mr. Hendrix told investigators that Mr. Westbrook continued to approach him, so he fired the shot into his chest. Deputies were six minutes away.\"When we sat down and told him the age of the victim and the diagnosis, he broke down and became emotional,\" Sheriff Wilson said.Within two weeks, investigators will meet with Herbert Franklin, the district attorney, to decide if Mr. Hendrix will face charges .Mr. Franklin is already weighing another so called Stand Your Ground case . Earlier in November, a 69 year old man in neighboring Catoosa County came home to find two teenagers trying to break into his house. He shot one in the neck, a 17 year old boy who died at the hospital.In both cases, Mr. Franklin will be guided by what legal experts call the \"reasonable person\" standard as outlined in the state's 2006 self defense law.\"In order to use deadly force, you have to reasonably believe you are in imminent danger,\" said the Gwinnett County district attorney, Danny Porter. \"You weigh whether the homeowner can show he was in fear of receiving death or great bodily injury.\"Nearly two dozen states have some version of a Stand Your Ground law, and their popularity continues to grow . The Ohio House of Representatives last month approved a bill that, like many, would remove the need for a person to retreat before using deadly force in self defense.Georgia's Stand Your Ground law was recently challenged by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, whose leader, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, came to the state in early November to announce a lawsuit against Gov . Nathan Deal and the state attorney general .Citing two recent cases, Mr. Jackson argued that the state's law was being unequally applied to whites and blacks .Mr. Westbrook's death shows the continuing controversy over the law, even here in a part of the country where gun ownership is treated as a cherished right. Chris Brown, 50, who lives down the street from the Westbrooks, supports Stand Your Ground laws. He is well armed and not afraid to pull out a gun if someone broke into his home or tried to steal his truck.\"But if he's out in my yard and I've done called the cops, I'm waiting for the cops,\" he said. \"What that guy did wasn't Stand Your Ground .\"Mr. Westbrook's widow herself is not sure that Mr. Hendrix should be charged.\"I don't know what his mind set was, and I don't know enough about the law to know,\" Mrs. Westbrook said. \"But that's all over now. His life is already taken. He took the life of a real gentle man, and it's a crying shame.\""}
{"_id": 6, "text": "NEWPORT, N.H. When the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police was looking to raise money for an annual cadet training program, it sold raffle tickets for 30 apiece. The drawing was scheduled for May, but by Jan. 12 all,000 tickets had been sold.The prize 31 guns, with a new winner drawn each day of the month.The fund raiser, sponsored by the association in partnership with two New Hampshire gun makers, Sig Sauer and Sturm, Ruger Company, has prompted a chorus of protests from lawmakers and gun control advocates questioning why the police are giving away guns, even in the name of a good cause.Some in law enforcement have also raised questions. When Chief Nicholas J. Giaccone Jr. of Hanover pulled up information about the raffle on the Internet, he said, he was flabbergasted.\"I looked at the first weapon and Googled that one,\" said Chief Giaccone, who recalled using an expletive when he pulled up information about the Ruger SR 556C, a semiautomatic weapon. \"It's an assault rifle.\"In a letter to the editor of The Eagle Tribune, which covers southern New Hampshire, Richard J. O'Shaughnessy of Salem wrote, \"People who should know better are adding to the glorification of the gun culture in this state .\"And referring to the shootings last month at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, State Representative Sharon L. Nordgren, a Hanover Democrat, said, \"They're just the same kind that were used in Newtown.\"The Ruger that caught Chief Giaccone's attention is an AR 15 style rifle, which is the most popular style of gun in America, according to dealers, and was the type used by Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six adults at the elementary school . Another gun in the raffle, the Sig Sauer P226 handgun, was also carried by Mr. Lanza, according to the Connecticut State Police .\"It's just ironic that that would be their choice of the kind of gun that they're raffling,\" Ms. Nordgren said. Organizers of the raffle are standing firm . In a statement released this month, Chief Paul T. Donovan of Salem, the president of the association, defended the fund raiser, saying that all winners would be required to meet all applicable rules for gun ownership .\"While this raffle falls on the heels of the recent tragedy in Newtown, Conn., the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police extends their deepest sympathies to the families and first responders,\" Chief Donovan wrote. \"New Hampshire Chiefs of Police feel the issues with these tragic shootings are ones that are contrary to lawful and responsible gun ownership .\"The proceeds from the raffle go toward a cadet program involving participants ages 14 to 20 who are given instructions in various kinds of police skills and procedures. Some of them go on to pursue careers in law enforcement .The guns will be distributed through another raffle partner, Rody's Gun Shop, a windowless outpost here in Newport, a town that comes to life when employees of Ruger, which is one of its main employers, leave work for the day.\"Around here, most people are into guns,\" said Michael Gaffney, an employee of a nearby hardware store who won a rifle in a raffle years ago . \"You get a chance to win a free gun! It's like any raffle, very much akin to trailer raffles, snowmobile raffles or turkey raffles.\"On a recent weeknight, the Rody's parking lot was filled with idling cars, their occupants waiting for the store to open at 6 o'clock. The store filled up immediately. Customers, some with their children in tow, browsed the shotguns and rifles on the walls and discussed the possibility of gun bans. While the shop's owner would not comment on the raffle, his customers were nonchalant.\"Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is they're just talking about it because of Sandy Hook,\" said Lorraine Peterson of Litchfield. \"I don't mean to sound insensitive. This is New Hampshire. This is a sport .\"Gun raffles are business as usual here and in many other parts of the country frequently used by hunting clubs and sometimes by athletics booster clubs to raise money and anchor galas.\"We host raffles like this all the time,\" said Richard Olson Jr., the president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation and the Londonderry Fish and Game Club. \"Anybody that's speaking up is using the Newtown massacre as a pretext to poke at the issue negatively.\"Mr. Olson said that he once planned a gun raffle to raise money for a fishing derby and that he was considering using one to raise money for the wildlife federation's conservation efforts on New England cottontail rabbits.Shifting economic and political conditions have spread gun raffles to other spheres, too. Josh Harms, a Republican state representative in Illinois, intends to raffle three guns in March to raise money for his campaign treasury.Greg Hay, a firefighter from Quincy, Ill., said his union decided last January to hold a gun raffle to replenish its accounts after a drawn out arbitration. He said the sluggish economy had limited fund raising from the union's annual country music concert.\"We didn't really want to have any more assessments, so we needed to start looking at better moneymakers,\" said Mr. Hay, who expects the union, Quincy Firefighters Local, to take home about,000 from the raffle, which started last June and awards one gun per week for a year.The fund raiser has been so successful that the union had planned to sponsor a second one until a recent increase in gun prices fueled by increased demand amid fears of gun bans in the wake of the Newtown shooting made the effort less promising.\"Maybe we'll hold off until gun prices go down and start to go back to a decent level,\" Mr. Hay said. Opponents of the raffle in New Hampshire are quick to say it is not the guns they oppose, but the fact that the police are conducting it.\"I think in some respects it shows the wrong message,\" said State Representative Stephen Shurtleff, Democrat of Merrimack. \"For law enforcement, normally they're dealing with firearms in a negative way. For that reason, it's just not an appropriate thing. We're trying to get guns off the street.\""}
{"_id": 6, "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS Mayor Michael R . Bloomberg of New York and the billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad have each donated hundreds of thousands of dollars . The National Rifle Association is buying political advertisements. New York's junior senator sent a fund raising e mail. And the election has attracted news coverage from as far away as Sweden.All this over a homegrown campaign to oust two Democratic state senators who provided crucial support for a package of strict new state gun control laws . As the recall elections the first of their kind in Colorado's history draw closer, the race has swelled from a local scuffle into a proxy battle in the nation's wrenching fight over gun control .Over all, both sides have dedicated about 2 million to the campaigns, most of it in support of the two senators John Morse, the president of the Colorado Senate, and Angela Giron, who represents the Southern Colorado city of Pueblo. That might not seem large compared with the multimillion dollar governors' races that can be commonplace across the country these days. But the money and the attention have transformed an off year campaign that started with homemade signs and volunteers collecting signatures in grocery store parking lots . Voters say they are being bombarded with telephone calls and pamphlets, radio and television commercials. Each day seems to bring a new procedural battle over the language on the recall ballot, how the vote will be conducted or which candidates will appear as possible replacements. Mr. Morse, who represents Colorado Springs, and Ms. Giron each have one Republican challenger on the ballot.Mr. Bloomberg, who has bankrolled other gun control supporters across the country, recently contributed,000 to fight the recall efforts. Mr. Broad gave,000. Senator Kirsten E . Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, has stepped in on behalf of Ms. Giron, in particular, enlisting support through her Off the Sidelines political action committee .Mr. Bloomberg \"has said he is going to support officials across the country who are willing to stand up to the N.R.A. and Washington gun lobby to support sane gun laws that will keep guns out of the hands of criminals,\" Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for the mayor, said in an e mail. \"These two senators did that.\"The N.R.A. has also jumped into the Sept. 10 race, contributing nearly,000 for mailings and radio, cable and online ads, according to campaign finance records.The influx of money has allowed each side to claim that its opponents are being manipulated by outside interests. One advertisement by the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners said Mr. Morse was taking \"marching orders\" from the \"billionaire playboy\" Mr. Bloomberg . A fund raising e mail from Senator Gillibrand called the election \"a wrongful recall by the N.R.A.\"Colorado's vote is being watched closely around the nation as a litmus test of how voters respond to new gun measures in a swing state with an ingrained culture of hunting, sport shooting and gun ownership .\"There's symbolic importance to both sides,\" said Eric Sondermann, a political analyst in Denver . \"If they're recalled, it would be interpreted as a rejection of the gun control agenda, a rejection of what Colorado passed. If these two prevail, then maybe that's one more nick in the armor of the N.R.A. and the gun advocates.\"To Democrats, the recall offers a chance to defend what they have called sensible and moderate gun regulations specifically, requiring background checks on private gun sales and limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. To firearms advocates, the vote is a way to demonstrate the political consequences of supporting gun control .\"The peasants have grabbed ahold of their pitchforks and torches,\" said Dudley Brown, the executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners .The passions on display in the recall effort also represent a widening rift in the state's identity, some analysts say, between the Colorado of F 150s, hunting trips and rural towns, and the Colorado of Subarus, ski passes and downtown lofts.This year, with Democrats' controlling the legislature and governor's mansion, they not only passed new gun control laws, but also laws allowing people living in the country illegally to pay in state tuition, creating new green energy requirements for rural electric cooperatives and approving civil unions for same sex couples .In Northern Colorado, some counties are so frustrated with the state's trajectory that they will vote this fall on whether to secede and form their own state ."}
{"_id": 7, "text": "WASHINGTON After a series of scandals involving high ranking officers, the American military for the first time will require generals and admirals to be evaluated by their peers and the people they command on qualities including personal character.The new effort is being led by Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as part of a broad overhaul of training and development programs for generals and admirals. It will include new courses to train the security detail, executive staffs and even the spouses of senior officers .Saying he was \"disturbed about the misconduct issues,\" General Dempsey said that evaluations of top officers needed to go beyond the traditional assessment of professional performance by superior officers alone. He said that he had decided the changes were necessary \"to assess both competence and character in a richer way.\"\"You can have someone of incredible character who can't lead their way out of a forward operating base because they don't have the competence to understand the application of military power, and that doesn't do me any good,\" General Dempsey said. \"Conversely, you can have someone who is intensely competent, who is steeped in the skills of the profession, but doesn't live a life of character. And that doesn't do me any good.\"A significant number of military personnel have been investigated, penalized and fired in recent months for poor judgment, financial malfeasance and sexual improprieties or sexual violence . Others were relieved for inappropriate leadership judgment while in command. General Dempsey said that regularly scheduled professional reviews would be transformed from top down assessments to the kind of \"360 degree performance evaluation\" often seen in corporate settings. He acknowledged that the change had already drawn concern from some in the military's senior ranks, who warned that it risked damaging a hierarchical command system based on discipline and adherence to orders from above. General Dempsey described the results of his review of officers' \"professional character\" during an interview in which he repeatedly stated his deep pride in the conduct of the vast majority of senior officers .He said he had found that the number of senior officers investigated by the Defense Department inspector general was not at an unusually high level . But the central role in national life played by the military since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 a time in which some general officers attained the stature, and entourages, of rock stars put them in the spotlight.\"We've been living with unconstrained resources for 10 years and, frankly, we've developed some bad habits,\" General Dempsey said, vowing to combat complacency. \"It's those bad habits we are seeking to overcome.\"Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who specializes in military culture, said he thought the 360 degree evaluation would have a positive effect on the leadership styles of many officers . \"It will reduce what the military calls 'toxic leadership,' elevating those who are highly competent but also fair and less brusque and peremptory,\" Dr. Kohn said.As for the new training programs, Dr. Kohn said that while it may be impossible to prevent willful infractions, \"most officers need to be reminded of the rules and regulations on a routine basis.\" General Dempsey said the demands of combat deployments in the past decade had prevented officers from attending the academic programs that historically had been integrated into an officer's career every few years, and he pledged to rebalance that.It is likely that the review will lead to a reduction in the overall number of generals and admirals, and the size of personal staffs, communications teams and security details. The review also looked at whether administrative staff members assigned to commanders had been used to run personal errands for officers and their spouses.Among the serious cases of misconduct in recent months, the four star general who previously served as the top officer in Africa, William Ward, was demoted to three star general after an investigation into misuse of government funds, including lavish travel with his wife. A one star officer, Jeffrey A. Sinclair, is facing a court martial on sexual misconduct charges involving a subordinate."}
{"_id": 7, "text": "In the generally upbeat annals of American military aviation, the plump, snub nosed little fighter called the Brewster Buffalo stands out as a turkey .The plane had its day of ignominy in the epic Battle of Midway in June, when 19 Marine pilots valiantly engaged Japanese Zeroes in dogfights above Midway Atoll, a strategic speck some,300 miles northwest of Honolulu . Only five of the pilots and planes returned.In his action report, one of the survivors complained that \"the Japanese Zero fighter can run circles around the F2A,\" the Brewster Buffalo model that had been handed down to the Marines by the Navy because its wheel struts broke during the hard landings on carriers .\"It is my belief that any commander that orders pilots out for combat in a F2A 3 should consider the pilot as lost before leaving the ground,\" wrote Capt. P. R. White of the Marines.Intercepting the Japanese fleet farther out to sea, the American carriers with more advanced aircraft fared better. In a victory that historians call the turning point in the Pacific War, American forces sank four Japanese aircraft carriers while losing only one.But among the Marines, the Buffalo won a reputation as a flying coffin. It was soon replaced by more agile fighters and the aircraft, along with the heroism of its hapless pilots, became a largely forgotten footnote.Now, the discovery of the rare wreckage of a Brewster Buffalo in the Midway lagoon, in only 10 feet of water, has rekindled interest in the aircraft and a record that, with the passage of time, seems as colorful as tragic.\"This is a very rare aircraft and to find even the wreckage of one is an exciting discovery,\" said Hill Goodspeed, the historian at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Fla. \"Midway is the site of one of the most famous battles in naval history.\"The exploration of the wreck is part of a broad federal effort to document and preserve the historical artifacts and biological wonders in 14 marine sanctuaries the United States has established since the 1970s, from the site of the Civil War ironclad Monitor in the Atlantic to the corals of the Florida Keys to the rich sea life and war relics of distant Pacific atolls.\"What we see underwater is really a huge museum of sorts,\" said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the sanctuary program. \"This wreckage is part of a larger story, the story of that tiny atoll and its place in world history.\"Of hundreds of Brewster Buffalos produced, all at a former car factory in Queens, N.Y., only one largely intact plane survives, a modified model that was sold to the Finns, who used them in the 1940s with more success against Soviet invaders. That craft was fished out of a Russian lake in 1998 and acquired by the Pensacola museum, but is now on loan in Finland.The newly discovered wreckage was spotted in June by federal divers who were cleaning up garbage around Midway Atoll, which is part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, a vast protected area covering the northwest string of the Hawaiian archipelago.The divers reported the intriguing sighting to Kelly Gleason, the monument's Honolulu based chief of marine archaeology. This summer, she led a team that mapped and photographed the half buried parts, including a bent propeller with a large coral head growing from its middle, tires with a Goodyear label intact and clusters of unspent ammunition.From the distinctive, notorious wheel struts, the nine cylinder engine and other evidence, Ms. Gleason said, she identified the wreck as a Brewster Buffalo . From Marine records she discovered that in February, a few months before the climactic battle, a Lt. Charles W. Somers Jr. landed short of the runway when returning in a dark squall. The plane sank as Lieutenant Somers swam to safety."}
{"_id": 7, "text": "WASHINGTON When President Obama nominates Chuck Hagel, the maverick Republican and former senator from Nebraska, to be his next secretary of defense, he will be turning to a trusted ally whose willingness to defy party loyalty and conventional wisdom won his admiration both in the Senate and on a 2008 tour of war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan .The choice of Mr. Hagel, the first Vietnam veteran to be nominated for the post, would add a prominent Republican to Mr. Obama's cabinet, providing some political cover for the president's plans to exit Afghanistan and make cuts to a military budget that has roughly doubled since the 2001 terrorist attacks .But Republicans made clear on Sunday that they would give Mr. Hagel a rough ride on his path to the Pentagon, questioning his support for Israel, his seriousness about the Iranian nuclear threat and his commitment to an adequate defense budget . And Mr. Obama may also face difficulties from some Democrats who are wary of negative comments that Mr. Hagel made more than a decade ago about gays .Some Obama aides had doubts about the wisdom of the choice, given Mr. Hagel's frosty relationship with members of his own party, but officials said they were confident that they could corral enough votes from both sides of the aisle to win confirmation in the Senate . White House officials confirmed on Sunday that Mr. Hagel was Mr. Obama's pick for the job and said the announcement would come as early as Monday.Rather than turning to a defense technocrat, Mr. Obama decided on an independent politician whose service in Vietnam gave him a lifelong skepticism about the commitment of American lives in overseas conflicts. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Hagel supported the war in Afghanistan but opposed the troop surge in Iraq under President George W . Bush.Mr. Hagel, 66, served as an enlisted man in Vietnam, won two Purple Hearts and still carries bits of shrapnel in his chest. He was the co founder of a cellular telephone company and headed an investment banking firm before being elected to the Senate in. He retired in 2009 and now teaches at Georgetown University and serves as chairman of the Atlantic Council, a centrist foreign policy group.In July, during the presidential campaign, Mr. Hagel accompanied Mr. Obama, who was then in the Senate, on a six day trip to Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and Kuwait. When Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee that year, asserted that Mr. Obama's motive for the trip was political, Mr. Hagel strongly defended Mr. Obama, saying in a television interview that Mr. McCain was \"on thin ground\" in trying to impugn Mr. Obama's patriotism.In the Senate, Mr. Hagel voted in favor of the resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to take military action in Iraq, which passed overwhelmingly in October. But he soured on the effort early, and became an advocate of the view that America had lost sight of what it was trying to accomplish and that it was overestimating its ability to change Iraqi society.In some ways, Mr. Hagel bears a similarity to Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and Mr. Obama's first choice for secretary of state . She withdrew her name from consideration, making way for the selection of Senator John F. Kerry . Ms. Rice, like Mr. Hagel, is a trusted Obama ally who spoke up for him during the 2008 presidential campaign and became a lightning rod for Republican attacks .\"The president wants someone whose judgment he respects on the big questions of war and peace,\" said Philip D. Zelikow, a senior State Department official under Mr. Bush and now a member of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board . Mr. Hagel is co chairman of the board .The White House is calculating that opposition to Mr. Hagel may be loud but not broad and that in end the Senate will confirm him. Administration officials argued that voting against a Republican war hero to run the Defense Department would not be easy for fellow Republicans, and they are confident that disgruntled Democrats will ultimately not deny their president his choice."}
{"_id": 7, "text": "WASHINGTON In his effusive endorsement of Chuck Hagel as his choice for secretary of defense on Monday, President Obama set in motion a White House campaign that officials predict will overcome weeks of accusations that the Republican former senator from Nebraska is anti Israel, antigay and soft on Iran .The president extolled Mr. Hagel's record as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, saying that he was \"the leader that our troops deserve.\" He described how Mr. Hagel once saved his brother, who was fighting alongside him, after he was wounded by a mine.\"With Chuck, our troops will always know, just as Sergeant Hagel was there for his own brother, Secretary Hagel will be there for you,\" said Mr. Obama, who was flanked by Mr. Hagel and the departing defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, at the White House ceremony.\"Maybe most importantly,\" the president continued, \"Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction. He understands that sending young Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud, that's something we do only when it's absolutely necessary.\"The president's message seemed intended in particular for the conservative critics of Mr. Hagel, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who have warned that he will face a bruising confirmation battle. White House officials said that Republicans, whatever their policy disagreements, would find it difficult to vote against an acknowledged war hero.Mr. Obama's announcement was part of a carefully calibrated White House strategy that has included reaching out to pro Israel lobbying groups, with a goal of wearing down the resistance to Mr. Hagel that erupted as soon as he emerged last month as a front runner for the Pentagon post.Conservative and Jewish groups reiterated their concerns on Monday that Mr. Hagel has opposed sanctions on Iran, failed to support Israel, and has advocated engaging with Hamas and Hezbollah . They want him to explain why he once referred to pro Israel lobbying groups as \"the Jewish lobby,\" a phrase they said was hurtful to Jews.Still, it was not clear how hard they will fight to block Mr. Hagel, now that the president has nominated him. \"We're not in the opposition camp, we're in the concerned camp,\" said David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, a centrist Jewish group. \"We're going to count on the Senate to examine, as it must, key issues of concern.\" Republican and some Democratic senators predict Mr. Hagel will still face tough questions about his views on Israel, Iran, and negotiating with Islamic militants . He has also faced criticism from gay rights organizations because of remarks he made 14 years ago for which he has since apologized about an openly gay diplomat.In a statement, Mr. McCain, a Vietnam veteran like Mr. Hagel who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, \"I have serious concerns about positions Senator Hagel has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years .\" But he added, \" Chuck Hagel served our nation with honor in Vietnam .\"The White House is working behind the scenes to mollify other potential critics. Administration officials said Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, called Howard Kohr, the executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most influential pro Israel lobbying groups .A spokesman for Aipac, Marshall Wittmann, said the group did not take a position on presidential nominations.Mr. Harris, of the American Jewish Committee, said Iran topped his list of concerns about Mr. Hagel because the senator voted against unilateral American sanctions against the Iranian government over its nuclear program and had argued against using the threat of military force to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti Defamation League, said the senators should challenge Mr. Hagel on his positions on Israel and Iran, which he said were \"so out of sync\" with those of the president.On Monday, White House officials rounded up examples of what they said showed the hypocrisy of the senator's critics. In e mails to reporters, they noted that Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice president television news networks and The Washington Times had all used the phrase \"Jewish lobby\" without generating a furor."}
{"_id": 7, "text": "FORT MEADE, Md. Adrian Lamo, the former computer hacker who reported Pfc. Bradley Manning to military authorities in May 2010 after Private Manning confided that he had provided vast archives of secret government documents to WikiLeaks, testified at the soldier's court martial on Tuesday that he saw parallels between his own youthful hacking offenses and those of the young Army intelligence analyst .Mr. Lamo, who testified for about half an hour, has been a polarizing figure in the WikiLeaks case . He is despised by many of Private Manning's supporters for betraying the trust of a person they see as an important whistle blower Mr. Lamo has maintained that turning Private Manning in was the socially responsible thing to do because his wholesale leaking recklessly endangered others.Mr. Lamo, who wore black clothing and a light beard, recounted how Private Manning sent him an encrypted e mail from his personal Google e mail account, and later contacted him via an online chat service around May, 2010. The two later connected on Facebook as well, but did not meet in person.Mr. Lamo said he first contacted a government official the day after the first online conversation, while continuing to chat online with Private Manning over the next week sometimes from his home in California, and sometimes from two nearby Starbucks where there was Internet access . The last chat, he said, was around May soon after, Private Manning was arrested.When Mr. Lamo was 22 the same age Private Manning was when he sent the information to WikiLeaks he hacked into the networks of several companies, including The New York Times . He pleaded guilty in 2004 to the offenses and was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two years of probation . He has since become a network threat analyst, and in 1998 he was appointed to a San Francisco government task force on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth issues.During cross examination, Private Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, focused on the portions of the chat logs showing that his client had reached out to Mr. Lamo at a time when he was struggling with his own sexual identity, had just spent several months downloading government secrets and sending them to WikiLeaks, and was scared and in turmoil .Mr. Coombs raised the parallels between Private Manning and Mr. Lamo, asking whether, based on their conversations, Mr. Lamo had seen \"someone very familiar\" to himself, a \"young 22 year old with good intentions like you were?\"Mr. Lamo replied, \"That was not lost on me.\"Asked if Private Manning had represented himself as a person who tried to investigate to find out the truth about matters, Mr. Lamo said, \"Something that I could appreciate, yes.\"Mr. Lamo answered with a simple \"yes\" to many other questions, like whether Private Manning had described some of the documents as exposing casualties in Iraq and whether he had expressed hope that his disclosures would prompt worldwide discussions and reforms. He also acknowledged asking Private Manning why he did not sell the documents to a foreign government, and said Private Manning had replied that the information should be public.But he also distanced himself from some of Private Manning's assertions in the chat logs. For example, asked if Private Manning had also told him how the more than,000 diplomatic cables he had leaked \"explained in detail how first world countries exploited third world countries,\" Mr. Lamo replied, \"He made that representation, yes.\"After Mr. Coombs finished, a prosecutor got Mr. Lamo to agree that Private Manning had mentioned Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and asked whether the private had admitted \"to compromising classified information at the thousands of documents level.\" Private Manning, now, sat quietly as the opposing lawyers questioned Mr. Lamo. He did not turn his head to watch as Mr. Lamo, who had testified at a pretrial hearing as well, walked out of the courtroom after being excused from the witness stand. Mr. Lamo later posted on Twitter a picture of a subpoena requiring him to appear and wrote \"My work here is done. Elsewhere, just beginning.\"There was a sharp drop from Monday in the presence of news organizations and protesters at the trial, which opened Monday at this military base near Baltimore, as it shifted from the drama of the opening statements toward chain of custody issues and other evidentiary matters.Mr. Lamo said he had allowed federal agents to take a hard drive from a laptop and a second computer he used for the chats, where the transcripts were automatically saved by the program he was using. He said he did not alter those transcripts, but did make copies of them and redact some portions before sending them to reporters for Wired magazine and The Washington Post .A forensic computer analyst also testified that he had recovered matching chat logs on computers belonging to Mr. Lamo and Private Manning covering May 21 to May, 2010.In addition, a former instructor testified that he trained Private Manning in 2008 to protect classified secrets and not to post information on the Internet that could help adversaries. He said Private Manning had stood out because he asked many questions in class and was the butt of jokes by classmates.A former sergeant who oversaw Private Manning's training unit, Brian Madrid, recalled an incident in which Private Manning drew scrutiny for making a YouTube video describing his schedule and training it used terms like \"Top Secret\" although it did not include any secrets .Mr. Madrid required him to make a class presentation on protecting operational information. Afterward, Private Manning said it would not happen again.A prosecutor asked Mr. Madrid whether it had happened again.\"I believe so that's why we're here,\" he replied."}
{"_id": 8, "text": "NEW YORK As the Republican controlled House of Representatives approved this month the most restrictive abortion bill to come out of Congress in at least a decade, abortion rights defenders mounted a full blown campaign to blunt what they instantly labeled \"a new war on women.\"\"The House of Representatives just passed the most extreme national anti choice bill we've seen in recent years,\" said Jess McIntosh, the communications director of Emily's List, which supports female Democratic candidates and is one of the largest political action committees in the United States . \"It's blatantly unconstitutional and decimates the rights of every single woman in the country,\" she told me by e mail immediately after the vote on June. \"This attack on our hardest fought rights cannot go unanswered.\"Her boss, Stephanie Schriock, the head of Emily's List, took the fight directly to the Republicans . \"It's clear that jobs, the economy and the well being of American women are not priorities for the G.O.P., which just jumps from one piece of terrible anti woman legislation to the next,\" she said. \"Women rejected the Republican agenda by historic margins in, but it's clear the G.O.P. hasn't learned its lesson.\"There is in fact little chance that the House measure, which would ban abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy, will see the light of day in the Democratic controlled Senate and White House .But it has undeniably had an effect Abortion is back on center stage in the countdown to the midterm elections next year, and the vote in the House served to put the spotlight on several key states where anti abortion forces have quietly made significant inroads.Prodded by public revulsion at the Philadelphia physician who was found guilty of murder for killing babies after botched late term abortions and citing a scientifically unproven theory that fetuses at 22 weeks can feel pain, House Republicans and conservative lawmakers in state legislatures have reinvigorated the debate about abortion and have had some success in limiting it.This is happening not only in Republican led states . For instance, on Friday in New York, considered among the most liberal of American states, the State Senate, which is controlled by Republicans and breakaway Democrats, refused to pass the Women's Equality Act, which included a provision to ensure abortion rights in the state .\"It's unfortunate that political grandstanding has triumphed in New York State to the detriment of gender equality,\" said Lauren Hersh, the New York director of Equality Now, an international organization working for justice for women and girls . With the recent House vote in mind, she said, the New York measure \"would have furthered women's rights to reproductive health at a time when they are being eroded around the country, not only at the state level, but also at the federal level .\"In the past three years, at least 11 states have passed laws restricting abortions at or near 22 weeks, the same limit imposed by the House's Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act . South Carolina and Wisconsin are considering similar bans Arkansas and North Dakota have passed abortion restrictions and in Ohio, an anti abortion bill would require transvaginal (invasive) ultrasounds.In Texas, spurred by Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, the State Senate passed a bill on June 18 that would close all but five abortion providers in the state . This came after the state had curbed funding for Planned Parenthood clinics. But the legislators put on hold, pending legal challenges, a provision similar to the House passed bill to limit abortions at 22 weeks of pregnancy . Abortion opponents get a boost from national polls that show that abortion rights do not enjoy overwhelming public support, unlike other hot social issues like same sex marriage and gun control . Polls vary, and none of them seem conclusive which of course helps to fuel controversy and prompts each side to dig up surveys backing their positions.Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, speaking on Fox News last Saturday, brought up a poll showing that some 60 percent of Americans opposed second trimester abortions. Ms. Blackburn led the anti abortion legislation on the House floor, though the bill's author was Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, who enraged some women with a comment that few rapes resulted in pregnancies. But Ms. Blackburn raised eyebrows, too, when she seemed to suggest that the House bill could lead to fewer rapes.In any case, a rekindled war over and between women has moved once again to the front lines in the American political and policy scene.And it resonates well beyond U.S. borders.\"What is happening in the United States signals to the rest of the world that there is far more work to do to break down barriers to accessing safe abortion for women everywhere,\" Pamela W. Barnes, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit global women's health organization EngenderHealth, said in an e mail.In EngenderHealth's 70 years of experience, she said, \"what is constant is that women, no matter how they live, will go to great lengths to end an unwanted pregnancy, even risking their lives.\""}
{"_id": 8, "text": "FARGO, N.D. Gov . Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota approved the nation's toughest abortion restrictions on Tuesday, signing into law a measure that would ban nearly all abortions and inviting a legal showdown over just how much states can limit access to the procedure.Mr. Dalrymple, a Republican, signed three bills passed by the Republican controlled Legislature in Bismarck. The most far reaching law forbids abortion once a fetal heartbeat is \"detectable,\" which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. Fetal heartbeats are detectable at that stage of pregnancy using a transvaginal ultrasound.Most legal scholars have said the law would violate the Supreme Court's finding in Roe v. Wade that abortions were permitted until the fetus was viable outside the womb, generally around 24 weeks. Even some leaders of the anti abortion movement nationally have predicted that laws banning abortion so early in pregnancy are virtually certain to be declared unconstitutional by federal courts .\"Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,\" Mr. Dalrymple said in a statement. The Supreme Court, he added, \"has never considered this precise restriction\" in the heartbeat bill.\"I think there's a lot of frustration in the pro life movement,\" said Paul B. Linton, a constitutional lawyer in Illinois who was formerly general counsel of Americans United for Life. \"Forty years after Roe v. Wade was decided, it's still the law of the land.\"The new laws place North Dakota, for the moment at least, at the center of sharp efforts in several Republican controlled states to curb abortion rights . Three weeks ago, Arkansas lawmakers adopted what at the time was the country's most stringent abortion limit, also tied to detection of a fetal heartbeat and banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy . That is the point at which a heartbeat can be detected using an abdominal ultrasound.The Arkansas and North Dakota laws have offered the first victories for an emerging faction of the anti abortion movement that is frustrated by the limited progress in curbing abortions and hopes that the Supreme Court might be ready for a radical rethinking.But that approach has caused divisions within the movement, with Mr. Linton and others calling it wishful thinkingThe North Dakota fetal heartbeat law and others like it, Mr. Linton said, \"have no chance in the courts .\" Abortion rights advocates who had gathered here to urge the governor to veto the bills quickly condemned his decision as effectively banning abortion in the state and as an attack on women. Without judicial intervention, the three bills are scheduled to take effect Aug. 1.\"In the past it's been, 'We're going to try and make it more difficult, more hoops, more obstacles for women to have to jump through or jump over,' \" said Tammi Kromenaker, the director of Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, the state's only abortion provider . \"But this is specifically 'Let's ban abortion. Let's do it. Let's challenge Roe v. Wade. Let's end abortion in North Dakota .' \" The Center for Reproductive Rights, in New York, immediately condemned the new laws and said it would file a challenge to the fetal heartbeat ban.Mr. Dalrymple also affirmed a law to require doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a local hospital, which could force the closing of the Red River clinic. A similar law adopted by Mississippi last year is under challenge in federal court .He also signed a third law that would prevent abortion in cases of gender preference or the first of its kind in the nation genetic defects, like Down syndrome.The signings come on top of a resolution approved by the North Dakota Legislature last week to amend the State Constitution to assert that life begins at conception, a move that would give a fetus the rights of a person and outlaw virtually all abortions. The so called personhood measure, asserting that \"the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and defended,\" will go on the ballot next year. Such measures have been voted down in Mississippi and Colorado .Mr. Dalrymple acted on the measures less than 24 hours after they were advanced to his desk.Similar measures to ban abortions when fetal heartbeats are detected are under consideration in several other states, including Kansas and Ohio ."}
{"_id": 8, "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union announced on Monday that it had filed a lawsuit against the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, arguing that their anti abortion directives to Catholic hospitals hamper proper care of pregnant women in medical distress, leading to medical negligence.The suit was filed in federal court in Michigan on Friday on behalf of a woman who says she did not receive accurate information or care at a Catholic hospital there, exposing her to dangerous infections after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy .In an unusual step, she is not suing the hospital, Mercy Health Partners in Muskegon, but rather the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops . Its ethical and religious directives, the suit alleges, require Catholic hospitals to avoid abortion or referrals, \"even when doing so places a woman's health or life at risk.\"The suit opens a new front in the clash over religious rights and medical care . The Catholic Church has fought against requiring all health plans to include coverage of contraception and is likely to call the new lawsuit an attack on its core religious principles.Catholic hospitals account for about one in six of the country's hospital beds and in many regions their influence is spreading as they forge alliances with non Catholic medical groups .\"This isn't about religious freedom, it's about medical care,\" said Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the civil liberties union, in a telephone news conference on Monday.Both the Muskegon hospital and the bishops conference declined to comment .Tamesha Means, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said that when she was 18 weeks pregnant her water broke and she rushed to Mercy Health, the only hospital in her county.Her fetus had virtually no chance of surviving, according to medical experts who reviewed the case, and in these circumstances doctors usually induce labor or surgically remove the fetus to reduce the mother's chances of infection.But the doctors at Mercy Health, Ms. Means said, did not tell her that the fetus could not survive or that continuing her pregnancy was risky and did not admit her for observation.She returned the next morning, bleeding and in pain, and was sent home again. That night she went a third time, feverish and writhing with pain she miscarried at the hospital and the fetus died soon after.At the news conference Monday, Dr. Douglas W. Laube, an obstetrician at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, described the care Ms. Means received as \"basic neglect.\" He added, \"It could have turned into a disaster, with both baby and mother dying.\"The A.C.L.U. said it had filed suit against the bishops because there had been several cases in recent years in which Catholic hospital policies on abortion had interfered with medical care .John M. Haas, president of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia and an adviser to the bishops, said he could not speak about the current suit because he was unfamiliar with it. But he said that the bishops' directives were more nuanced than critics allege, allowing for actions to treat a woman at risk even if that treatment might result in the loss of the fetus.He said some hospitals might have misinterpreted the bishops' rules and added that doctors were required to tell patients of potential risks and alternatives, though they may not provide direct abortion referrals.In, the diocese of Phoenix stripped a hospital of its affiliation after doctors there said they performed an abortion to save a mother's life."}
{"_id": 8, "text": "NEW YORK Not since Sarah Palin's splashy debut in U.S. politics in August 2008 has any female politician come out of obscurity and, virtually overnight, captured the eye of the political and media world like the belle from Fort Worth, Texas Wendy Davis, the state senator whose marathon filibuster of a restrictive abortion bill is now history.In just a few weeks, the Wendy Davis phenomenon has grown exponentially. She is no longer just a rising star in the Democratic Party constellation. She has risen. Democrats in Washington, in Texas and around the nation, marshaled by female activists, are clamoring for her to run for governor in 2014 no matter that her chances of winning are slim in a state that has not elected a Democratic chief executive in more than 20 years.Some people in her political circle believe she might just pull off a stunning victory, which would upend politics in Texas and give new life to the Democratic Party movement to turn the state blue.Ms. Davis made headlines last week in Washington when she told a rapt audience at the National Press Club that she would decide by Labor Day, Sept. 2.Emboldened by her newly found celebrity and her own charisma and guts plus some deep pockets among her supporters in and out of Texas she could challenge the moneyed, conservative Texas Republican establishment and its likely candidate, Attorney General Greg Abbott .\"I want Wendy Davis to run for governor,\" Senator Kirsten E . Gillibrand of New York told me on Friday. Ms. Gillibrand, who won re election by a landslide last November, is undeterred by speculation that Ms. Davis cannot win in Texas . She believes that even if Ms. Davis were to lose the race, she would still command a big platform in the nation's second largest state, one that would reverberate nationwide, to discuss tough issues like women's reproductive health, abortion rights, education, jobs and the middle class . \"She will elevate the conversation.\"Ms. Davis's reach extends beyond Texas thanks in part to a media and publicity campaign fashioned by one of her biggest champions, Emily's List, the political action committee that works to elect female Democrats who support abortion rights .Next Friday, Ms. Davis will headline an Emily's List program in San Francisco featuring two other activists Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law student who became a celebrity when the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a \"slut\" for supporting a requirement that health insurers cover contraceptives, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, one of two female combat veterans elected in 2012 and the first Hindu American to serve in Congress .In addition to headlining that major event, Ms. Davis has recently been added to Emily's List's lineup of rising stars and potential female presidential candidates in, 2020 and beyond. That list starts with Hillary Rodham Clinton and includes younger Democrats like Ms. Gillibrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota .And for all that, Ms. Davis is not the brightest sun of this political summer. Mrs. Clinton is, of course.Here, too, Emily's List has jumped on the bandwagon. Traveling across the country, putting on carefully targeted forums and town halls, its \"Madam President\" initiative is zeroing attention as if any were needed on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats' overwhelming favorite to be their choice for president in.At a recent gathering in Des Moines, Iowa, a crucial state in the presidential sweepstakes, Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily's List, said that a poll conducted for her organization of likely Democratic caucus participants in Iowa showed that 96 percent of them would vote for a woman to be president.Those poll results are remarkable only because Iowa has never elected a female governor, senator or member of the House. Iowa was the site of an early brutal defeat in Mrs. Clinton's run for the presidency five years ago, but the poll results suggest that next time would be different.\"This is going to change very, very quickly,\" Ms. Schriock told The Quad City Times last week. \"We're already seeing it in the numbers. And that's why I think we've got a really good opportunity here to have Iowa lead the way on nominating the first woman presidential candidate in the Democratic Party .\"Perhaps to drive home the point of Mrs. Clinton's inevitability, the featured speaker at the forum was Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who reiterated her all out support. Ms. McCaskill's enthusiasm is relatively new. Not only did she support Barack Obama over Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 race, but she has been frequently quoted as having once said that she would not want her daughter anywhere near Bill Clinton.Not all is coming up roses for Democratic women. There's a general feeling among advocates and activists that the women's movement has peaked and that not enough women are signing up to run and work on campaigns. \"We have stalled,\" Ms. Gillibrand said, citing a reason she introduced her \"Off the Sidelines\" campaign two years ago .Last week Emily's List said it had singled out Los Angeles for intensive efforts to recruit, train and help finance female candidates, according to The New York Times . Los Angeles, the second largest city in America, behind New York, has a female population of.9 million and politically liberal demographics, yet only one woman holds elective office in the entire citywide government . She's a member of the City Council from the San Fernando Valley, hardly an empowering position.As for Ms. Davis, she has hit a nerve. Even before stepping into the governor's race in Texas and making all the usual enemies, she has roiled conservative waters in the Red Nation. Now they call her \"abortion Barbie.\""}
{"_id": 8, "text": "A women's rights group filed a lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday to block the country's most stringent abortion law, a North Dakota ban on abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy.Adopted in March, the law forbids abortions once a fetal heartbeat is \"detectable,\" which can be as early as six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant. Rights groups and the state's only abortion clinic, the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, promised at the time to bring a legal challenge .According to the Supreme Court, women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, which is often around 24 weeks into pregnancy. The enforcement of another early limit on abortions a ban at 12 weeks that was enacted by Arkansas in March was temporarily blocked last month by a federal judge, who said it was likely to be found unconstitutional.The latest lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Bismarck by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of the clinic in Fargo. The suit is also challenging the constitutionality of two other measures adopted by North Dakota this year one barring abortion because of genetic defects in the fetus, the first provision of its kind in the country and one barring abortions for the purpose of sex selection.The challenged measures \"seek to interfere directly in personal, private medical decisions that the Constitution and more than 40 years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent guarantee to women as a fundamental right,\" said Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights .The adoption by North Dakota and Arkansas of early abortion bans based on the detection of a fetal heartbeat were the first victories for an impatient faction of the anti abortion movement that is seeking aggressive action to end abortions. Proponents know the laws will face stiff legal resistance but are intending to take the fight to the Supreme Court, where they hope a majority might be ready to scrap the fetal viability threshold that has stood for decades.More mainstream organizations that oppose abortion, including the National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic Church, have advocated an incremental strategy of tightening regulations on clinics and working to ban abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization. Such bans, based on the scientifically disputed argument that the fetus can feel pain at that stage, have been adopted by 11 states . These laws are also inconsistent with Supreme Court rulings and have been temporarily blocked or declared unconstitutional in Arizona, Georgia and Idaho .On Monday, the Texas House of Representatives adopted a 20 week ban and other rules that could force dozens of abortion clinics to close. The measures, which are supported by Gov . Rick Perry, a Republican, were expected to be debated by the State Senate on Tuesday."}

{"_id": 9, "text": "MOULINS, France Like his fabled appetites for dance and sex, Rudolf Nureyev's hunger for collecting was insatiable. By, when he was 45 and became director of the Paris Opera Ballet, he was the rock star of dance and a very rich man, with homes all over the world filled with treasures.His taste for the sumptuous is evident in the ballets he staged, particularly for that company, which has just begun a monthlong run of his opulent \"Sleeping Beauty,\" a grand scale vision of a royal court and its riches. Nureyev's own homes were fully the equal of these lavish sets, and now many of his belongings have been gathered into a permanent collection that offers visitors a sense of his exuberant, vagabond personality and passion for all that was rare and beautiful.It has taken the 20 years since Nureyev's death from AIDS in, but the new Nureyev Collection, which opened in October at the Centre National du Costume de Sc ne, the national theatrical costume museum here in the Auvergne region of France, has turned out to be the \"lieu de memoire,\" or \"place of memory,\" that Nureyev requested in his will.Moulins, in central France, a three hour train ride from Paris, is a surprising choice Nureyev requested that his collection be in Paris, his favorite city. But the difficulty of finding the right space and ever increasing property prices in that capital made the search slow going, said Charles Jude, a former Paris Opera Ballet star who is on the board of the Rudolf Nureyev Foundation, which oversees the dancer's legacy.Thierry Fouquet, another board member who was the dance administrator at the Paris Opera during Nureyev's tenure and is now the director of the Bordeaux Opera, said, \"We looked hard for a long time, without success.\" He added, in a telephone interview, that the delay was also a result of lawsuits brought against the foundation in its administration of the estate by members of Nureyev's family, among other legal tangles.In, most of Nureyev's thousands of possessions were sold at highly publicized auctions in London and New York. The foundation kept back a relatively small portion of these, of which the museum received around 300 pieces, said Delphine Pinasa, its director. (Some objects went to a museum in Ufa, Russia, where Nureyev grew up, while documents and recordings went to the National Dance Center in Paris, and personal papers went to the Biblioth que Nationale.)The objects that were not auctioned were dispersed, some to storage spaces all over the world and some to the Mus e Carnavalet in Paris, where, according to Ariane Dollfus, who has written a biography of Nureyev, many pieces were damaged because of inadequate storage conditions.In 2008 the Nureyev Foundation approached the Moulins costume museum, which had opened two years earlier . \"The condition of the gift was that we open a space permanently dedicated to Nureyev,\" Ms. Pinasa said.Centre National du Costume de Sc ne is in the Quartier Villars, an elegantly proportioned 18th century barracks, renovated and extended after a near brush with demolition in. After the French government approved the idea of creating an archive for costumes belonging to the Paris Opera, the Com die Fran aise and the Biblioth que Nationale, it took almost another decade to renovate the premises and add a section to contain and conserve the vast holdings. The government contributed around 80 percent of the renovation budget needed to install the collection (about,000), with the remainder coming from the museum and the foundation.\"It's an international and important name that clearly draws people here,\" Ms. Pinasa said. \"The first few weeks have been very good.\"The collection is shown in three large rooms set apart from the museum's main exhibition space they were designed by Ezio Frigerio, who created sets for several of Nureyev's productions . The first room is decorated with painted stage flats and offers spotlighted costumes in glass booths. Some were Nureyev's own, most touchingly a simple pale blue doublet worn soon after his 1961 defection to the West, in \"The Nutcracker.\" There are also costumes from the ballets he staged, notably Hanae Mori's 1920s style outfit for Sylvie Guillem in \"Cinderella,\" an enchantment of pale pink pleated silk, feathers and sequins, and the gold embroidered blue green silk tunic that is the warrior hero Solor's costume in the Nureyev production of \"La Bayad re.\""}

He identified them as Randy Crespo, Edward Gonz lez, Jos Justiz, Ariadni Mart n, Luis Victor Santana, Annie Ruiz D az and Alejandro M ndez.Four of the dancers talked about their decision on a program on Am rica TeV, a Spanish language station in Miami . \"It was difficult, because all of our families are there in Cuba,\" Ms. Ruiz D az said. \"We're thinking of a better future, both economically and artistically.\"The seven join a long roster of dancers, not to mention baseball players and other athletes, who have made their way to the United States from Cuba. Many of the dancers have permission from the Cuban authorities to stay in the United States to perform, but those tend to be soloists and stars. Five National Ballet dancers stayed behind in Canada in, and three in.Cuba is a rich source of ballet talent, thanks to the empire built by Alicia Alonso, 91, the determined director of the National Ballet, who helped found what would become the company in, and Fidel Castro's support for building a ballet tradition. Several of the dancers interviewed on Am rica TeV praised Ms. Alonso, who persevered although she has been largely blind for decades.Many Cuban dancers who defected in recent decades have found places in major companies in the United States . But Jane Hermann, the dance agent who has helped bring the National Ballet to the United States on a half dozen tours, said it was not always easy.\"We are not state subsidized,\" Ms. Hermann said of the American scene, pointing out that few companies pay a full year's salary . \"I would just hate to see these children end up waiting tables because they can't get a job to allow them to rent an apartment.\" She added that one or two National Ballet dancers defect from most of the tours she has booked.At the same time, she acknowledged that a lack of money for the National Ballet in recent years had left the company in a moribund artistic state . \"It's economic, but it's also artistic,\" she said. \"There isn't a great deal of creativity going on there because Alicia can't see.\"Ms. Ruiz D az said she was game for anything. \"The kind of work I do doesn't matter, to get to the future I want,\" she said. \"I see myself dancing ballet, classical, contemporary, Neo Classical. I'd like to dance in various branches but to dance.\""}
{"_id": 9, "text": "PARIS Benjamin Millepied, the choreographer and a former principal at New York City Ballet, will be the new director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, starting in September.The announcement on Thursday morning at the Palais Garnier by the general director of the Paris Opera, Nicolas Joel, ends months of intense speculation surrounding the successor to Brigitte Lef vre, the director of dance at the Paris Opera since 1995 who plans to retire at the end of the 2013 14 season.Mr. Millepied's appointment comes as a surprise as it was generally expected that a current or former company member would be chosen to lead one of the world's grandest and most traditional ensembles. The shortlist was considered to come from a small group of Paris Opera Ballet insiders, including the star dancers, or toiles, Nicolas Le Riche, due to retire in, and Laurent Hilaire, a ballet master with the company and Ms. Lef vre's right hand man .Although Mr. Millepied, 35, was born in Bordeaux and trained at the Lyon Conservatory, he joined the School of American Ballet as a teenager. His subsequent professional career as a dancer was spent with City Ballet, where he rose quickly through the ranks to become a principal dancer in. He retired in 2011 to focus on choreography, and moved to Los Angeles, where he founded the L.A. Dance Project last year.In an interview on Wednesday at his hotel here, Mr. Millepied said he was approached relatively recently, in mid November, by St phane Lissner, artistic director of La Scala, who is to succeed Mr. Joel as general director in. In the Paris Opera hierarchy, the director of dance's artistic policy is subject to the approval of the general director, but in past decades there has been little interference or involvement.\"I certainly knew about the position, but I also knew that there were candidates from within the company,\" Mr. Millepied said. \"I was surprised, but I felt very quickly that the artistic dialogue between us was an exciting one. After a while I did feel there was a really good chance I might get the position. Which made my head spin.\"Well it might.Mr. Millepied will inherit one of the world's greatest classical troupes. It has 150 dancers, a complex hierarchy of ranking and promotions and the sizable weight of history the company is effectively an outgrowth of the very beginnings of ballet at the court of Louis XIV. Its dancers almost all come from the Paris Opera Ballet school, and they rarely leave to dance elsewhere once they have achieved a coveted position in the company .They are also civil servants, with long term contracts that run until their mandatory retirement, with pension, at. And with the notable exception of Ms. Lef vre, directors tend to drop like flies at the Paris Opera . Even Rudolf Nureyev lasted only six stormy, if productive, years in the 1980s, while directors like John Taras and Violette Verdy managed just a few seasons.The byzantine politics, scale and bureaucracy of the Paris Opera are worlds away from Mr. Millepied's professional experience. He has long put together touring groups, and even at the peak of his dancing career was an indefatigable organizer of small choreographic projects and festivals with musicians and artists. He is a prolific choreographer who has created works for major companies (including American Ballet Theater, City Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, and his public profile is high, thanks partly to his work on the Darren Aronofsky film \" Black Swan \" and his subsequent marriage to its star, Natalie Portman.But his new company, the L.A. Dance Project, which made its debut in September in Los Angeles, is small and experimental in orientation. (Mr. Millepied said he planned to continue running the L.A. Dance Project until he began his new job, when he would move to Paris with Ms. Portman and their son. He said he hoped the company, which has a budget guaranteed for the next three years, would continue.)"}
{"_id": 9, "text": "Tights and point shoes, bunions and tape, a prince and his princess in dance, certain things always go together. But another kind of pairing, the choreographic duo, hasn't always been so successful. Sol Le n and Paul Lightfoot of Nederlands Dans Theater are an exception.\"I think everyone assumes when you work as a choreographer, it's just you,\" Ms. Le n said recently by phone from her home at The Hague, where the company is based. \"To work as a duo, everyone thinks, 'Well, that can't really work.' \" Ms. Le n and Mr. Lightfoot were already frequent dance partners and romantically involved when they started creating pieces together in the late 1980s. \"Normally choreography becomes a monologue one person's point of view, taking inspiration from another artist, maybe, but actually just one has the voice,\" she said. \"But in our case it's not like this.\"Some 25 years and 40 pieces later, through the breakup of their romantic relationship and through Mr. Lightfoot's 2011 appointment as the Dans Theater artistic director, they have continued to create together. This week, for the first time in nearly a decade, they'll bring the company to New York for a program at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, presented by the Joyce Theater.Their journey has not been without challenges Mr. Lightfoot, also on the phone, laughed as he recalled the first piece he and Ms. Le n made together \"The Bard of Avon\" in, at the behest of the company's revered artistic director and choreographer Jiri Kylian. \"The first ballet was terrible, an absolute stinker,\" he said.Nonetheless both Mr. Kylian and Hans van Manen, then a resident choreographer, encouraged the pair to create more. At first Ms. Le n said it was too much pressure, and she chose to leave her name off their collaborative works. But eventually, \"in the studio, the dancers would say, 'Who is the one?' \" she recalled. \"And we'd say 'Well, it's actually two. It's like papa and mama.' \"Early on the pair worked to develop a choreographic language that would distinguish them from the many other choreographers then at Dans Theater, including William Forsythe, Ohad Naharin and, above all, Mr. Kylian. \"We were surrounded by amazing choreographers, and it's a wonderful thing to feel, but it's also important to be sure you're not left in the shadow of other people's styles,\" Mr. Lightfoot said.Mr. Lightfoot and Ms. Le n came to Dans Theater from very different backgrounds. He grew up in England and trained at the Royal Ballet she was raised in southern Spain and only began serious professional training at. They have found common ground in a style rooted in rigorous ballet technique, elegantly neo classical in look but punctuated by strong, often rapid fire gestural movement. Their dances vary widely in mood, from playful to darkly dramatic, but they are often highlighted perhaps not accidentally by an intricate onstage partnership.They often start work in separate studios. \"We usually begin with too many ideas and then slowly refine ourselves, or each other,\" Mr. Lightfoot said.Ms. Le n added \"Sometimes with all the ideas Paul has, it will get to the point where I say, 'Yeah, but what?' I push toward the message. I want to see the reason of why we are doing things.\"At some point in the process, Mr. Lightfoot said, they each realize they need the other's input to move forward.Rehearsing with them can be \"a very intense experience,\" said Lawrence Rhodes, the artistic director of Juilliard's dance division, who worked with Ms. Le n and Mr. Lightfoot at Dans Theater in the '90s. \"Doing that work and being with them, one on one, for an hour, it's a lot. It's pretty draining.\" Mr. Lightfoot and Ms. Le n will teach class and work with students at Juilliard during their time in New York."}
{"_id": 9, "text": "It's expensive to produce new ballets. There are few remarkable ballet choreographers to make them. The outcome is uncertain. Mixed repertory programs don't sell well. What audiences really want and will pay for are full length story ballets, preferably \" Swan Lake \" or \"The Nutcracker.\"So goes the refrain among a great number of North American ballet companies when talk turns to the scarcity of new works or ballet's imminent demise. (It's always terminal, apparently.)And then there is San Francisco Ballet, where several premieres happen every season, the repertory is packed with pieces created in recent years, and houses are reliably full. Under the leadership of Helgi Tomasson, the company has become one of the world's most important vehicles for new ballet choreography, rivaled only in the United States by New York City Ballet, and in Europe by the Stuttgart Ballet, Dutch National Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet.On Wednesday, the company offers New York a taste of its repertory in an ambitious two week season at the David H. Koch Theater that was almost derailed by a dispute between the dancers' union and the management. Luckily for New York audiences, it was resolved, and the company arrives as scheduled, with an initial week of four mixed bill combinations of seven works, six of them commissioned by San Francisco in the last three years. (The seventh, Serge Lifar's \"Suite en Blanc,\" jumps back to.)The choreographers include major international figures like Alexei Ratmansky, Mark Morris, Wayne McGregor and Christopher Wheeldon, as well as the company's resident choreographer, Yuri Possokhov Mr. Tomasson and Edwaard Liang. Even the full length \"Cinderella,\" which concludes the season, was recently commissioned (with Dutch National Ballet ) from Mr. Wheeldon, a choreographer who has had a long association with the company and has created some of his finest works there.The credit is due to the Icelandic born Mr. Tomasson, 71, who has made new work a central tenet of his artistic policy since he took over the company in.\"It goes way back, to when I first came to New York to study,\" he said by telephone from San Francisco . \"I joined the Joffrey Ballet, where Robert Joffrey was really the first ballet director to be bringing in choreographers like Alvin Ailey and Glen Tetley. It was fascinating to me, and I think that ignited something in me that stayed.\"In, Mr. Tomasson joined New York City Ballet, where he was a principal dancer for 15 years. \"You had Balanchine and Robbins doing new work all the time,\" he said. \"For me it was the norm, and when I went to San Francisco, I knew that my main idea was to search for something new all the time.\"Mr. Tomasson emphasized his respect for tradition the company has an extensive Balanchine repertory, performs the classics and does the obligatory \"Nutcracker\" season every December. But his programs tell where his heart lies as is true of this New York tour, a majority (usually six out of eight each year) are mixed repertory. And yes, they sell well, he said, sounding mildly surprised.\"Even in the recession, they didn't buy less tickets,\" he said. \"They like this work, and they get to see so many more principal dancers perform than in a full length ballet, where you really only have two or three.\"Mr. Tomasson spends considerable time each year traveling in order to see new work. He said that he looks for choreographers with a good knowledge of the classical vocabulary, but that he is open to different aesthetics, citing the work of William Forsythe and Mr. McGregor. Not every work gets raves, but Mr. Tomasson is phlegmatic \"You keep at it, and hopefully good ballets will pop up,\" he said.The company commissions three or four new ballets a year, on average (this season there will be premieres from Val Caniparoli, Mr. Tomasson and the rising young British choreographer Liam Scarlett, and Mr. Tomasson said that he tries to present something new to West Coast audiences in each program, even if it is not a company commission . Later this season, Mr. Ratamanksy's ambitious \"Shostakovich Trilogy,\" created for American Ballet Theater, joins the company's repertory.\"Yes, he does hire people you see elsewhere,\" said Mr. Wheeldon, whose 2010 \"Ghosts\" will be performed in New York for the first time during this run. \"But there is always some sort of coup with Helgi. He doesn't bring things in because they are in fashion he brings what he believes in, which is impressive.\"That belief is apparent in the regularity with which Mr. Tomasson offers certain choreographers repeat commissions . Mr. Morris has created eight pieces for the company since \"Maelstrom\" in his most recent, \"Beaux,\" described by Alastair Macaulay in The New York Times as \"the happiest rethink of masculinity that ballet has seen in decades,\" will be shown during the troupe's New York season.For his part, Mr. Morris said in a telephone interview \"I think they are fabulous, in many ways the best ballet company we've got. They do my work the way I intend it to be done. Helgi, pretty much alone amidst big ballet directors who choreograph, is noncompetitive. He is completely hands off, trusts the people he hires and has curated an excellent group of dancers. Working with them has decided how I work with ballet companies in general.\"Mr. Morris said he had created the all male \"Beaux,\" set to music by Bohuslav Martinu, partly in response to the demands of San Francisco's schedule on dancers. (His other reason, he said, was that he was \"tired of the fake virility in ballet.\")Unlike most ballet companies, which alternate rehearsal and performance periods throughout a season, San Francisco has a marathon rehearsal period from August to December, then performs continuously through May.\"It can be really tricky with scheduling,\" Mr. Morris said. \"I think it's really hard on the dancers to learn so many ballets at once.\"Mr. Wheeldon, who is almost up to Mr. Morris's tally, with seven pieces for the company since, said he felt the long rehearsal period was conducive to creativity.\"It's long, but very focused,\" he said. \"There is more time to play around, a longer gestation period, and the dancers are so used to making new work that they are the perfect tools for a choreographer.\""}
{"_id": 9, "text": "It was supposed to be a summer fling. In 1989 Lincoln Center celebrated its 30th birthday by staging a big band dance party on the plaza for 20 nights. (There wasn't enough money for 30 nights.)But New Yorkers fell in love with the music, the dancing, the outdoor vibe. The relationship endured, and Midsummer Night Swing, now in Damrosch Park, is celebrating its 25th anniversary.For three weeks there's at least one band per night for dancing alfresco swing, salsa, tango and the less well known styles, like soca. Before the music starts an expert teacher gives a lesson in the dance theme for the night.\"From year to year, it was like watching a meadow,\" Rebecca Weller, who produced the event through, said. Different dances and different subcultures would flower and dominate. In the early '90s the tango was hot in, the macarena. Then swing swung back.Ms. Weller remembers compas bands from Haiti with special fondness. \"Taxi cabs in the vicinity would multiply,\" she said. One night a compas band with Sweet Micky (Michel Martelly, the current president of Haiti) led a rara parade around Lincoln Center . \"I was the bane of security guards,\" Ms. Weller said.The crowd reflects the city in age, ethnicity, size, skill level, personality and fashion sense. There are singles and couples, paired up strangers and circles of friends. Different bands attract different crowds, so each night has its own character and energy, but there's always a miscellany, a cross section of New York mingling to music.Still, the festival has its dancers with the season passes who go every night, the veteran musicians and teachers who have watched the event change, the people whose lives have been changed by it. Here, a few of the regulars.A Regular Who Follows in Her Parents' FootstepsThe movie star name doesn't hurt, but Lana Turner, 63, turns the heads of people who don't know her with her sartorial elegance and her radiant joy in dancing. A Harlem native who sells real estate and runs an archiving business, she's been coming to Midsummer Night Swing for the last decade or so, ever since her son left home, and she had more time for herself.The festival reminds Ms. Turner of her mother and father, a chambermaid and a chauffeur who regularly went out dancing and dressed up to do so. Her father would take her through the dance steps, allowing her to stand on his shoes. \"It harkens back to a time,\" she said, \"when people were able to extend themselves in a personable way. Their jobs did not define them. Their social graces did.\"Ms. Turner organizes her summer around the festival, careful that if she takes her grandson on a trip, she's back in time for opening night . She picks out her her first outfit early.\"I'm not a big salsa girl,\" she said. \"It's too crowded. But I'm there most of the time. Going every night allows you to try things you may not have a predisposition for.\" That's how she learned the Texas Two Step.With his big band, the Nighthawks, Vince Giordano played the first year of Midsummer Night Swing, then the 10th anniversary, and is back this season. \"It's a wonderful piece of New York,\" he said. \"We play other gigs, and sometimes people dance, sometimes they don't. When we play this event, people are there to dance. It's like it used to be.\"Mr. Giordano, 61, brings back music of the 1920s through the 1940s, and in recent years he has noticed a surge of younger people on the dance floor, a trend he ascribes to period movies and TV shows like \"Boardwalk Empire,\" for which his band provided much of the music. \"I wish I had that audience when I got started,\" he said. \"There's an energy that goes back and forth between the dancers and the band.\"His favorite memory of the festival comes from a 10th anniversary performance. At his day job in the music industry back then, he found,000 Frisbees about to be thrown out. He labeled them with the name of his band, and at the end of the show he sent them flying into the audience. \"It was great to see the little old ladies trampling people to get the Frisbees,\" he said.Devoted to the Romance of the Dance"}
{"_id": 9, "text": "Ivan Vasiliev stood at the back of a large rehearsal room at American Ballet Theater's headquarters downtown on Broadway, restlessly waiting his turn as the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky worked with a group of dancers. He bounced on the balls of his feet, swung his arms back and forth and made a face at his girlfriend, the ballerina Natalia Osipova, who sat calmly on the floor to one side. Then, with little visible preparation, he suddenly spun into a pirouette, turning so many times that a group of corps de ballet members, sitting close by, laughed and whistled.Mr. Vasiliev, 24, who joined Ballet Theater as a principal in September last year, is famous for sensational technical feats soaring, space devouring jumps, spinning top multiple turns and for a particularly Russian brash charm and larger than life confidence that contrasts with the more demure American style. His talents are currently on display at the Metropolitan Opera House where Ballet Theater's season runs through July.He is famous too for his onstage partnership with Ms. Osipova, and for their joint departure, in, from the mighty Bolshoi Ballet, where they were both principals, to join the far less prestigious Mikhailovsky Ballet.Since then, there have been more twists in the tale Mr. Vasiliev added his name to the roster of international stars at Ballet Theater, where Ms. Osipova was already a principal. And Ms. Osipova recently announced that she would join the Royal Ballet as a principal dancer next season, while still dancing with American Ballet Theater, and that both would leave the Mikhailovsky this summer.\"I could not be permanently settled in one company,\" Mr. Vasiliev said a few hours after the rehearsal. \"I think now everybody is looking for other opportunities. You no longer have a lifelong contract with one place. It's not a problem with a company it's me. Maybe I'm crazy.\"Mr. Vasiliev grinned engagingly. He had turned up for the interview in shiny gold moon boots and part of his longish wavy brown hair pulled up into a little sprouting ponytail at the top of his head. Although a translator was present, and he spoke in Russian most of the time, his English is admirable, peppered with joking asides.Asked if he had been singled out as particularly talented when he was growing up, he shook his head . \"I still don't know if that's the case,\" he said, poker faced.He was born in Vladivostok, the far eastern port city, and began ballet classes at, moving to a professional ballet school in Minsk at. In his teens, he won both the Varna and Moscow ballet competitions, drawing the attention of Mr. Ratmansky, who was then the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet .\"We invited him to come to the Bolshoi for audition,\" Mr. Ratmansky wrote in an e mail message. \"I taught him class and also asked to do a modern piece he did for the competition. He had to laugh out loud during that piece, and I remember thinking, 'Wow, he is fearless.' \"Mr. Ratmansky, who was looking for a partner for Ms. Osipova, whom he had hired two years earlier, engaged Mr. Vasiliev in the face of strong opposition from the artistic staff at the Bolshoi. Like Ms. Osipova, he said, Mr. Vasiliev was not considered classical enough to dance the great 19th century ballet roles.\"The same things were said about the greatest dancers in the past (Cecchetti, Legnani, Messerer, Lepeshinskaya,\" he wrote, \"so I knew I was right in hiring them. Their young talents, sheer physicality and charisma more than compensated for the lack of refined lines or good manners.\"Mr. Vasiliev does not have the kind of physique considered suitable for \"white tights\" roles, a reference to the costume worn by the princely characters in ballets like \" Swan Lake \" or \"Sleeping Beauty.\" He is of medium height and is powerfully built, with thick, muscular thighs that recall photographs of Nijinsky. In classical ballet, where prejudices about body types aren't confined to ballerinas, a leading man must be lean, long limbed and elegant. (Not that Mr. Vasiliev is lacking in appeal one British critic reported a colleague as describing the dancer as \"sex on legs.\")\"He is specialized on some level,\" said Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater, who said that he didn't immediately think of hiring Mr. Vasiliev after first seeing him dance. \"Here is someone with amazing capabilities, who raises the bar, but you might not think he'd do Albrecht\" (from \"Giselle.\"I had to be somewhat clear with him that that's the way it would be,\" Mr. McKenzie said.Mr. Vasiliev may not be dancing the princely roles at Ballet Theater he will appear in \"Don Quixote\" and Mr. Ratmansky's new \"Piano Concerto No. 1\" this week, and \"Le Corsaire\" in the first week of June but he has already danced several of them elsewhere. One of his reasons, he said, for leaving the Bolshoi for the Mikhailovsky, was to break out of the bravura stereotype.\"I danced Spartacus and I was typecast,\" he said, referring to the eponymous hero of the 1968 ballet by Yuri Grigorovich that has become a byword for male virtuosity of a particularly unsubtle kind. \"It was necessary for people to forget I was Spartacus. When things get too familiar, you want to change everything and start from the beginning.\"He was quick to add that he was not implying anything negative about the Bolshoi, which has been the subject of intense scrutiny earlier this year following a brutal acid attack on the ballet company's artistic director, Sergei Filin, and the subsequent arrest of a company member, Pavel Dmitrichenko.\"I can say nothing about this,\" said Mr. Vasiliev, when asked if he had been aware of tensions and hostility during his time at the Bolshoi. \"It's not the ballet world, it's criminal and something really terrible. Personally, I love the Bolshoi theater, it's our alpha, how I started and part of my soul.\"Mr. Vasiliev is expected to continue to dance with Ballet Theater, but the company's concentrated seasons mean he has a great deal of freedom to dance elsewhere. He will move with Ms. Osipova to London when she goes to the Royal Ballet, he said, and among other plans has appearances with her lined up at La Scala, where he will dance Romeo in Kenneth MacMillan's \" Romeo and Juliet \" for the first time.Whether Mr. Vasiliev's peripatetic career will enable him to develop fully as an artist is the essential question for his future.\"I think people want to see him at what he does best, so he has very few chances to explore,\" Mr. Ratmansky wrote. \"I would like him to spend at least two hours every day with the toughest classical teacher who can help him improve his lines, placement and turnout. If he does that, he will secure for himself a long, healthy and adventurous career.\"Debra Craine, the chief dance critic of The Times of London, said in a telephone interview that it was important for Mr. Vasiliev to work with choreographers on new pieces. \"Because he is not a typical leading man, doing new work is even more important for his career, and if choreographers don't get the time to create roles for him, he won't develop to his full potential,\" she said.Perhaps Mr. Vasiliev is aware of that.\"I would love to dance everything,\" he said, laughing. \"I would love to make new work, too. I'm available. Can I leave my number? Choreographers, call me please.\""}
{"_id": 9, "text": "Trisha Brown, a dance experimentalist of the 1960s and '70s who went on to help define contemporary dance performance, has decided to withdraw from leading the company she founded because of health problems but has given her blessing to its continued existence, her associates said on Thursday.Ms. Brown, 76, had a series of mini strokes in the past several years, although she was choreographing as recently as the fall of 2011 and was active at the company until last summer, said Barbara Dufty, executive director of the Trisha Brown Dance Theater . But she has had increased difficulty communicating recently and is relinquishing the title of artistic director of the company that bears her name. Ms. Brown said in December that two works she choreographed, which are being performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week, would be her last.She named the longtime collaborators Diane Madden and Carolyn Lucas as associate artistic directors. Both have danced for Ms. Brown since the 1980s and moved into other roles. Ms. Lucas became Ms. Brown's choreographic assistant, and Ms. Madden became rehearsal director.The company will immediately begin a three year international farewell tour to present Ms. Brown's more traditional stage works, as well as plan to produce site specific dances. It will also establish an archive and create a Web site of Brown materials.Those materials are immense. They include notebooks, audio recordings, film footage and writings. But they are chiefly a mass of videotapes Ms. Brown recorded almost every rehearsal. Catalogers have been organizing the material since, and the work is expected to continue for another year, Ms. Dufty said.Brown company officials will also continue to license her dances and will maintain an office and staff. \"We have a lot of riches to offer,\" Ms. Dufty said. \"The only thing that's missing is Trisha's physical presence . Her work lives on.\"The announcement returns attention to a vexing issue particular to the ephemeral art form of dance. Highly individualistic choreographers build a body of work and companies around themselves and, like other mortals, age and die. The question arises of what to do with the dances, the material that went into making them and the people who served the artistic vision.The Brown plan largely reflects the strategy adopted by the choreographer Merce Cunningham, who died in. His company closed down in 2011 after an international tour, but measures were established to preserve his legacy and to pass on his steps.The Brown company consulted with the people who set up the Cunningham plan, although they seemed to have stopped short of announcing eventual closure of the company .Ms. Brown collaborated with Robert Rauschenberg, Laurie Anderson and Mikhail Baryshnikov, among others, and studied with Cunningham. She adopted the modernist concept of dance movement independent of music or design, and examined the principles of movement in a systematic way but also reveled in its sensuous possibilities.In a recent article Alastair Macaulay, chief dance critic for The New York Times, cited the \"poetic fluidity of her movement\" and the \"steely, analytical methods of her choreographic structures.\""}
{"_id": 9, "text": "The music video is in black and white . It consists entirely of women dancing in high heels, wearing identical, flesh hugging outfits that expose their upper thighs. It is not Beyonc 's \"Single Ladies,\" probably the most famous dance video of this century. It is \"Stop,\" by the choreographer Susan Marshall.The similarities are intentional, as are the differences. In \"Stop,\" there are two equal dancers, rather than a star flanked by two look alikes. The choreographic structure is a little more complex, with more counterpoint, less unison. The gestures are a bit less sexualized, closer to the Supremes than to strippers, and the music, rather than the cheerleader chant of Beyonc 's song, is guitar and drums.But the differences go deeper. The thrashing guitar music is by David Lang, a Pulitzer Prize winning composer. Ms. Marshall has been honored with a MacArthur grant. These are not the sorts of artists who normally make music videos . (The director, William Cusick, has dabbled before, but that's less unusual for directors.) \"Stop\" isn't a stand alone music video at all. It's a companion piece to \"Play Pause,\" a 75 minute dance that will have its New York debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday.Considering Beyonc 's acknowledged borrowing, in another video, from the esteemed Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, \"Stop\" could be considered a retaliatory raid, a show of solidarity by a choreographer who, like Ms. De Keersmaeker, presents work at the Brooklyn Academy. (Though considering how much \"Single Ladies\" borrows from Bob Fosse, the trails of appropriation and reappropriation get tangled.) But \"Stop\" and \"Play Pause\" arose from a different line of thought.Though Ms. Marshall works in a noncommercial zone and teaches at Princeton, she did not fail to notice the dance boom in recent popular culture, the competition TV shows and movies and viral Internet trends. She wondered if a strict separation from pop culture was serving her art. Might her dance pieces, which tend to be preoccupied with fragments of narrative, subtle hints of relationships and multivalent metaphors, partake more of the pleasure she gets from dancing to her favorite bands?As often happens, this question survives only as a texture or layer in \"Play Pause,\" a touch of familiarity. That's one function of the video. Viewers can watch \"Stop\" online, and when its choreography appears in \"Play Pause,\" they can recognize it. The video is something of a teaser, a trailer, though the aesthetic of the rest of the live work is quite different.This accessibility, however, also worries Ms. Marshall, she said. It troubles her that already more people have seen \"Stop\" than will see \"Play Pause.\" Possibly, more people will see it than have seen (or ever will see) any of her live shows, people who won't know how little it is like her usual work. \"Stop\" is a potential portal between elite theaters that seat a few hundred people and page views in the thousands or, if the video should go viral, the hundreds of thousands, the millions.These worlds are ordinarily so separate that a collision like the Beyonc De Keersmaeker scandal has the sound of a culture clash, of people speaking different languages. One of the few choreographers to have traveled between is Trish Sie, but much of her story only emphasizes the divide.The videos Ms. Sie has choreographed for the band OK Go (her brother, Damian Kulash, is the lead singer ) have page views in the tens of millions . Their 2002 do it yourself video \"A Million Ways\" in which the band members, clearly not trained dancers, did a tongue in cheek routine in Mr. Kulash's backyard made them stars. Hundreds of fans, from all over the world, posted their own versions a new metric of a successful music video in an age when MTV had moved on to reality shows and people were saying the music video was dead.More success the 2006 video \"Here It Goes Again,\" a clever routine on treadmills, won a Grammy Ms. Marshall is a fan led, in, to a collaboration with the venerable dance troupe Pilobolus. Members of that company appeared in the video for \"All Is Not Lost,\" a kaleidoscope of bodies on a glass table filmed from below. Pilobolus, in turn, recreated the video live in some of its performances a stunt slightly varied the following year with the tango themed \"Skyscrapers.\"If this strategy sidestepped most of the differences between music videos and concert dance like the challenge of extending a choreographic idea past a couple of minutes it captured some of the charm of OK Go videos Usually filmed in a continuous take, they share some of a live performance's sense of potential accident. (Actually, the more heavily edited \"All Is Not Lost\" and \"Skyscrapers\" are anomalous in this regard the live re creations restored them to the OK Go norm.) Much of the popularity of OK Go videos derives from how they casually defy the music video convention of beautiful bodies chopped up by fast cuts.Ms. Sie's collaboration with Pilobolus this year, \"Licks,\" has no connection to a video, but she is not much more likely to become Ms. Marshall's kind of choreographer than Ms. Marshall is to choreograph videos for pop bands. Though Ms. Sie grew up studying ballet and modern dance as well as competitive ballroom, she feels uncomfortable with concert dance. She admires the seriousness and creativity, but she said she often finds it self indulgent, overly cerebral, arrogant."}
{"_id": 10, "text": "As Daniel Day Lewis cracked jokes on the Oscars stage last month two related thoughts came to mind. First, why wasn't any of this wit evident in his disconnected, oddly timid performance in \"Lincoln,\" for which he had just won the best actor award?Second, why is the Daniel Day Lewis generally acknowledged as the best film actor of the 2000s so far so much less fun to watch than the Day Lewis who was (along with Morgan Freeman) the best and most exciting film actor of the late 1980s?His arrival on American screens was electrifying and prodigious, with exceptional and highly varied performances in \"My Beautiful Laundrette,\" \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" and \"My Left Foot \" (followed closely, in the early '90s, by \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and \"In the Name of the Father. Bringing intelligence, seductiveness and subtlety to recognizably human characters a gay British punk, a Czech doctor during the cold war, a disabled Irish artist he was both more charismatic and more interesting than he's been as the monsters, profane or sacred, that he's played in overweening productions like \"Gangs of New York,\" \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"Lincoln.\"To an American filmgoer it could seem as if Mr. Day Lewis appeared in 1986 (in \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" and \"A Room With a View,\" released on the same day in New York) fully formed and near the height of his powers . But viewers on the other side of the Atlantic had already been watching him as a featured performer for several years in the traditional proving ground of the British actor the BBC drama .On Tuesday Americans will get a chance to explore Mr. Day Lewis's roots when BBC Home Entertainment releases two DVD sets with samples of his work for television. \"My Brother Jonathan\" (1985) is a five part mini series, in which he starred as an idealistic young doctor working in the industrial squalor of the West Midlands around the time of World War I. \" Daniel Day Lewis Triple Feature\" collects a hodgepodge of performances, both starring and supporting, broadcast from 1982 to. (Both sets are listed at.98.)The DVDs were smartly timed to coincide with Mr. Day Lewis's latest Oscar victory (he was also a winner for \"There Will Be Blood\" in 2008 and \"My Left Foot \" in, but they may be a shock to viewers unfamiliar with the studio bound, low budget, seriously talky 1980s BBC aesthetic. All period pieces with literary sources or inspirations, they sometimes feel more than just three decades old.That's particularly true of \"Dangerous Corner, an installment of a series with the self explanatory title \"BBC Play of the Month.\" In this case the play is a 1932 potboiler by J. B. Priestley in which Mr. Day Lewis plays a member of a seemingly charmed circle of friends and business partners that falls apart during one night's revelations of affairs, thefts, drug addiction and a love that almost but not quite speaks its name. (David Robb, who plays the central character, may be familiar from his more recent role as Dr. Clarkson in \"Downton Abbey.\")The self consciously daring (and claustrophobically staged) proceedings feel like a less florid precursor to \"Suddenly Last Summer\" set in an English drawing room rather than a Southern asylum and Mr. Day Lewis, as a young and somewhat simpering member of the group who tends toward genteel hysteria, doesn't transcend the material. Most of the time he looks outclassed by the more experienced performers around him. But he does manage to steal a number of scenes by sitting silently in the background and scowling, nodding, pursing his lips or intensely examining his fingernails an early indication of his ability to strike a pose.He is at the center of the 1982 TV movie \"How Many Miles to Babylon?,\" a World War I story based on a novel by the Irish writer Jennifer Johnston that packs a lot of themes into its 111 minutes Irish nationalism, British prejudices, the violent horrors of trench warfare and the Freudian horrors of a childhood in the Anglo Irish gentry. He plays Alex, the son of Anglo Irish landowners, whose intense bond with a village boy is condemned by his domineering, class conscious mother (a frighteningly icy Sian Phillips. The two men are reunited on the battlefield in France, where the military bureaucracy reacts as negatively to their friendship as Alex's mother did, and with more tragic consequences. The lead role gives Mr. Day Lewis's natural charisma more of a chance to assert itself, but his portrayal feels muffled he's constrained by the stiff upper lip sentimentality of the story and the clich s of repression and nobility that Alex represents.He manages to give a star performance, though, in \"My Brother Jonathan,\" which was shown just a few months before his breakout movie performance in \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" was seen in Britain. It's another literary adaptation, this time from a novel by Francis Brett Young, who wrote a series of stories depicting life in the Midlands."}
{"_id": 10, "text": "BURNABY, British Columbia Evidence of witchcraft was all over the house actually a soundstage in suburban Vancouver . A wine glass full of feathers. Apothecary bottles filled with dried roots and herbs. The bodies of beetles and scorpions, neatly mounted under glass. A wooden light fixture whose frame, when viewed from a certain angle, suggested a pentagram.You probably wouldn't notice the curios, most of them tucked discreetly on shelves or hanging on cluttered walls, unless you knew what they were the stuff of spells, ancient bits of magic, hiding in plain sight .They reflect the premise of \"Witches of East End,\" a series beginning Sunday on Lifetime and based on the best selling novel by Melissa de la Cruz that a family of witches, the Beauchamps, has lived in a small Long Island town for centuries. The mother (played by Julia Ormond) has been cursed to see her daughters die horrible deaths, lifetime after lifetime (including once in Salem, because of their powers and those who were threatened by them. So this time around, she hasn't told the young women what they are or practiced witchcraft in their presence, hoping it will change their fate.The series is part of a resurgence in witch theme TV shows, the perhaps inevitable response to a supernatural marketplace already saturated with zombies and vampires. Ryan Murphy's \" American Horror Story \" anthology series begins its third season Wednesday on FX with \"Coven,\" a New Orleans based tale of witchcraft and voodoo. WGN America's first scripted series, \"Salem,\" scheduled for next year, is set during the 17th century Massachusetts witch trials.Though witches have always been prominent in popular culture from the three witches in \"Macbeth\" to \"The Wizard of Oz \" and the nose twitching comedy of \"Bewitched\" they have almost always been second class genre citizens. They're usually relegated to sidekick or villain status in fantasy dramas, protagonists only in lighter, comedic fare like \"Wicked\" on Broadway or \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\" on television. It's been 15 years since \"Charmed,\" the last successful witch TV series, went on the air (and 7 since it ended. And there has never been a witch centered blockbuster to rival the vampire craze of \"Twilight\" or even the zombie walk generating fan devotion to \" The Walking Dead .\"\"We have development meetings where we talk about what kind of shows we want to do, and what kind of shows we think will attract a mass audience,\" said Nina Lederman, the senior vice president for scripted series at Lifetime, whose programs target a mostly female audience. \"We all felt we wanted to be in the supernatural space. We looked at all the vampires and zombies that were out there and realized no one was doing witches. We saw that as a huge opportunity and felt we should jump on it.\"Shaina Goelman, a coordinator in Lifetime's scripted series department, went searching for books about witches last year and came across \"Witches of East End .\" The book seemed a perfect fit It was aimed at adults but was also filled with \"Twilight\" like love triangles, complicated mythology involving Norse gods and strong female lead characters.\"Witches of East End \" isn't as dark and gory as \"True Blood\" or \"American Horror,\" but it isn't a comedy either. \"The programming landscape has gotten edgier and darker in general,\" Ms. Lederman said. \"In the past, witch stories have had to be campier or have a sense of comedy to succeed, especially for a female audience. I think their taste has evolved.\"This was important to Maggie Friedman, who adapted and serves as an executive producer of the Lifetime version of \"Witches of East End .\" She previously was the head writer and executive producer of \"Eastwick\" ABC's failed adaptation of John Updike's 1984 novel, \"The Witches of Eastwick.\" (The 1987 film version, though, starring Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Jack Nicholson, was a modest success.)\"This show is tonally very different from 'Eastwick,' which is part of why I wanted to do it,\" Ms. Friedman said in a telephone interview from the show's Los Angeles writing office. (She said she had fretted about being \"typecast as just that girl who writes about witches, because I've written on all kinds of other TV shows,\" but she liked the story so much she set aside her concerns.)\"There's a long history of witch shows on television feeling light, and I wanted the stories in this one to have consequences. I wanted this to feel like a world where people could die, where bad things could happen,\" Ms. Friedman said."}
{"_id": 10, "text": "With her toothless grin, floppy hat and tell it like it is persona, Moms Mabley may be one of the most influential comedians you don't know. She rose to fame in the early decades of the 20th century on the chitlins circuit the collection of stages around the country that employed black entertainers during segregation and she would go on to a career that spanned more than 50 years. In that time, she pushed beyond racial and gender barriers, but she drew mainstream attention only starting in the 196os (she died in 1975) and little of her work has survived on film or video. That hasn't deterred Whoopi Goldberg.In the documentary \"Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley,\" which will be shown on Monday on HBO, she traces the comic's life and talks with performers who were influenced by Mabley, including Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, Joan Rivers, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte.Though Ms. Goldberg has held many jobs comedian, actress, talk show host, screenwriter and film producer this is her first time directing a feature. \"I was never interested, because I really have no attention span,\" she said.To make the film, she began with a development deal at HBO, but after disagreements over the project's direction, Ms. Goldberg turned to Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site. Asked about the decision to raise money from the public, she was forthright. \"I think you mean to be saying 'You seem to have enough money to do this. Why are you asking for help?' \" she said. \"Because I needed it. I didn't have enough money to do it and run our company and take care of all the other things. I'm the only one working.\"Lowering her voice to a whisper, she added \"I'm not Oprah. So I went to Kickstarter.\"Reviewing the documentary on its premiere in April at the Tribeca Film Festival, Frank Scheck wrote in The Hollywood Reporter that \"it well succeeds in its admirable mission of bringing Mabley's trailblazing and still relevant humor to an entirely new generation.\"In an interview at the festival and a follow up this month, Ms. Goldberg spoke about how she discovered Mabley as a child and the influence Mabley had on her own comedy . \"I knew there were records in the house that you weren't supposed to touch,\" because of the salty language, she said. \"And then she would be on Ed Sullivan, and my mom would let us watch. And somehow she flew into my mouth. I don't know how it worked, but she's in there.\"Though Ms. Goldberg became well versed in Mabley's comedy, the same could not be said about her life. \"I didn't know all the things I discovered while making the documentary,\" Ms. Goldberg said. \"We discovered she was the first female stand up, because, in trying to find comparable there was no one for 40 years. And when she was performing at the Apollo, she was the highest paid entertainer. She made crazy money for the time.\"One topic the film explores is Mabley's sexual identity. \"She liked women,\" Ms. Goldberg said. \"We had heard that Moms was gay . This is a rumor that had been around forever. And then when we started talking to folks, we talked to the dancer Norma Miller,\" who knew Mabley when both performed at the Apollo Theater. \"She says 'We never called Moms a homosexual. we never called her gay . We called her Mr. Moms.' \"Faced with a lack of images, Ms. Goldberg ended up pairing animation segments with her recordings. \"They didn't film black performers back then,\" Ms. Goldberg said. \"So most people don't know Moms until the '60s when they saw her on 'Playboy After Dark' or the Smothers Brothers or Mike Douglas. There are recordings, but there's no footage of her performing except for two movies she's in.\"\"Everything for me is visual,\" Ms. Goldberg added. \"That's just how my head works. I knew there was not a lot to work with and that we were going to have to make it fun. I love animation, so I said, 'We're going to make a cartoon.' But others questioned it. People gave me the stink eye for animation. But it was the only thing we could do. Otherwise, you're looking at a blank screen.\"As for the disagreement with Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO Documentary Films, \"it's a long and very strange story,\" Ms. Goldberg said. \"Sheila Nevins and I had been friends a long time. And she was aware that I was going to do this. She met with me and said, 'We'll do it with you.' Then it took a different turn than the direction HBO thought it should be going in. We had some bumping head issues and finally decided to part ways.\"Even then, the plan was to show the completed film to HBO at that point, the channel came back on board . \"It worked out better for me, because it became the piece that I saw in my head, which was a piece about Moms's influence on comedy,\" Ms. Goldberg said.In a telephone interview, Ms. Nevins said that HBO had hoped that Ms. Goldberg would play Mabley and make the film a combination of stand up, documentary and interview footage. \"We had a very pleasant time working on it, and then Whoopi really didn't want to do Moms for it,\" Ms. Nevins said. \"We thought we had developed it up to this point, and that we were friends, and that no one could ever do Moms the way Whoopi could. And so we parted on the project.\"Ms. Nevins said she sent Ms. Goldberg a check to Kickstarter when the project was posted there, and when the film returned to the HBO fold, Ms. Nevins added, \"it was like she came home again.\"So what element of Moms Mabley's work was most influential on Ms. Goldberg and the comedian she became? \"The storytelling,\" she promptly responded. \"It's the same thing with Richard Pryor. It's the stories. I don't have to be bam, bam, bam, funny when I'm working. I can tell stories and there's some funny in them. But they move around. But the two of them in particular gave me that freedom.\""}
{"_id": 10, "text": "On the Internet found material is often recycled as comedy a decade old commercial, a foreign music video, an amateur's footage from the zoo. But for the Brooklyn comedy troupe Sunset Television the opposite is true. Its videos are meant to play like artifacts discovered in serpentine YouTube searches.Take the sketch \" Real Life Exorcisms,\" from, a 3 minute 20 second video modeled on paranormal reality shows like \"Ghost Hunters the sound design, captions and mood are indistinguishable from the material it parodies. The absurd story, however, includes a dog medium and a possessed girl whose garbled monologue is recorded and played in reverse by a priest to reveal nonsense \"I like diamonds. And cats and sports. And, uh, awesome tattoos. Lesbian Tattoos.\" The YouTube page includes the faulty description, \" 100 REAL EXORCISM FOOTAGE.\"Like much of Sunset Television's work the humor is poker faced, and most of the,865 comments posted online involve earnest questions about authenticity. Approaching eight million views now, the video, also available via the group's Web site, is by far its most popular, and the comedians embrace the utterly confused response.\"In the beginning Sunset aimed to blur the lines between fact and fiction,\" Karrie Crouse, the group's only female member, said recently at Mother's, a bar in Williamsburg where group members often meet to discuss new ideas. \"We wanted the videos to feel excavated, difficult to date or place in a particular culture.\"She and the other members Drew Blatman, Alex Goldberg, Graham Mason, all in their late 20s or early 30s met in 2007 in the graduate film program at Columbia University . There they made 7 to 15 minute collages that appeared to be transmissions from a twisted, satirical dimension of television footage from school projects and appropriated Internet material were edited into a slurry of bizarre commercials, film trailers, old fashioned public service announcements and other slivers of televised culture, most of which lasted around a minute or two.\"It was kind of like being in a band at times,\" Mr. Blatman said. \"We'd get together and just jam on found footage. It still feels that way.\"The group produced five such episodes from 2008 to, each constructed as a channel surfing stream of jokes. Actors were hired from Craigslist, sometimes for explicit scenes (like eating a sandwich, naked while crying) a process also used by \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!,\" whose lo fi stylized look was an influence on Sunset Television.\"The great thing about being on the Internet is nobody can cancel us,\" Ms. Crouse said, laughing.In 2011 Pitchfork, the music Web site, reran the group's early episodes, and financed shorter, more narrative leaning sketches. Noting that the videos had a kinship with the music of artists like Ariel Pink and R. Stevie Moore, known for their low fidelity aesthetic, R J Bentler, Pitchfork's vice president for video programming said, \"I thought maybe there could be a connection with our audience.\"The group's association with music circles got the attention of Beirut, the Balkan influenced band started by Zach Condon, who commissioned two bittersweet, nostalgic music videos . \"I remember watching what went up on their Web site on a weekly basis,\" Mr. Condon said. \"Whole evenings with my friends were devoted to recognizing every subtle underhanded joke and absurdity in their videos.\"Though they consider themselves a comedy group, the members of Sunset TV aren't connected to the New York stand up or improv scenes, partly because their brand of humor is based on filmmaking, not live performance. Sunset Television builds on the work of sketch television standouts like the State, Kids in the Hall and Mr. Show. What's funny about the Sunset videos is the group's ability to replicate the details in genres like Czech New Wave and television crime drama, both in writing and in cinematic technique. \"For a comedy group we're not as concerned with L.P.M.,\" or laughs per minute, Ms. Crouse said, \"which makes the whole project a little more complicated.\"Some members of the group act more, some shoot more, but all four are involved in every step of the process, from pitching to postproduction. They also have their own outside projects Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Blatman are members of Weird Days, a production firm that recently finished videos for the singer Santigold. Mr. Goldberg also has a small role this season in the HBO series \"Girls,\" and Mr. Blatman is working on a documentary about jai alai. Ms. Crouse wrote (with the director Martha Stephens ) and acted in the independent feature, \"Pilgrim Song,\" and Mr. Mason is a screenwriter.The group's most recent project is \"Two Cops,\" a six episode Web series that emphasizes understated acting and narrative over the manic collage of its early work. The videos are disguised as a fly on the wall documentary from 1981 during a supposedly recessionary New York in which police officers in financial straits are ordered to share living quarters . The show never leaves the apartment of the two cops Charlie Doogayn (\"a nut for the details\") and the PCP addicted Ricardo Martinez (\"a real loose cannon the only thing he loves more than motorbikes is his sister, played with unflinching earnestness by Mr. Mason and Mr. Goldberg, who are both new to acting.Though the setup is akin to fake documentaries like \"The Office,\" the pacing is slower and the look is bleaker, deliberately reminiscent of documentaries like Frederick Wiseman's \"Hospital\" from. And the sad sack officers call to mind \"Louis\" and other melancholic television comedies .The series, which cost a grand total of, was filmed entirely in Mr. Blatman's apartment, allowing for an unhurried, improvisational approach. \"On 'Two Cops' we used the first 10 takes just trying to figure out how the characters speak,\" Mr. Goldberg said.Though there are no plans for Sunset Television to make the leap to actual television, the members are increasingly drawn toward the emotional breadth of continuing story lines . \"Initially we wanted the work to feel as if it were totally found,\" Mr. Mason said. \"But these days we're owning up to the fact that we're making it. We're putting ourselves in there.\""}
{"_id": 10, "text": "Go to one of them it doesn't matter which and you'll probably come away thinking \"Two hours of cheesy hype with a few good jokes thrown in.\" But go to a bunch and you might start to view them as artfully constructed character studies, poignant tableaus in which a central figure the network uses a facade of jokes and stardust to hide a mass of fears and insecurities. Dang it, these gaudy spectacles are actually small masterpieces in the best tears of a clown tradition.The upfronts, which took place this week across Manhattan, are dress up gatherings at which networks large and small unveil their coming schedules for advertisers and try to make the case that their shows are a better ad buy than anyone else's shows. Making that case generally involves leading with some jokes, then reminding the audience that each and every one of the network's returning series or sports programs is the most watched show on television among some obscure demographic. At some point, glimpses are provided of new series, all of which feature the most exciting actors working today and were created by someone who once had a series or movie that was successful or at least wasn't a complete flop.Stars are trotted out to wave and then go back to wherever it is that TV stars spend their downtime. Throughout, the crowd is pummeled with so many dizzying video collages that pop up migraine clinics materialize outside the theaters.A talk show type, if the network has one, might do a jokey monologue, and the executives too try their hand at stand up. The most fearless is Steve Koonin, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, who this year served up a funny bit in which he did acrobatic flips, juggled while riding a unicycle and showed off formidable break dancing skills. At least, it looked like him. The flashy stunts were actually performed by look alikes, dressed and bewigged to mimic his distinctive appearance, which is to be polite not particularly athletic.Staid CBS surprised the crowd at Carnegie Hall with a funny bit by Jo Ann Ross, the network's president of sales, who announced that she was not there to give the ad buyers in the audience a hard sell. While she spoke, messages like \"Buy\" and \"Your ad here\" were projected onto her skirt.Later in CBS's event, Robin Williams, who will have a new series called \"The Crazy Ones\" on the network this fall, vamped for a few minutes about the good old days, when ideas for new shows were hatched amid mounds of cocaine. Is it a good sign when your president of sales is funnier than your biggest fall season star? Maybe not. (Another not good sign both the CBS event and NBC's at Radio City Music Hall featured parodies of the same \" Les Mis rables \" song. Thus is creativity defined in TV land.)Taken collectively, the executive humor at the upfronts tends to be rooted in self deprecation. But when the real comics come out, the tone shifts now the events are akin to those themed restaurants where the waiters and waitresses insult and otherwise abuse the diners. Jimmy Kimmel, a fixture of the ABC upfront this year's was at Avery Fisher Hall has this down to an art form . (Parodying the executives who had appeared earlier, he spoke of \"a revolutionary new made up way for us to take your money from you.\") Conan O'Brien did similar stuff at the TBS TNT event at the Hammerstein Ballroom.Hear enough of these two types of humor, the self debasing and the just give us your dough material, and you begin to recognize the classic defense mechanisms of the insecure either make fun of yourself or make fun of those you fear. And there is plenty of insecurity at the upfronts . Networks these days are beleaguered, with viewership declining and audiences looking for entertainment in other places. At every upfront, a sense of desperation was lurking these networks are desperate to convince advertisers that they are not networks in the stodgy, old media sense.\"Multiscreen\" may have been the most used word of the week as executives described various initiatives to reach viewers on cellphones, notebooks, whatever. Phrases like \"scalable marketing initiatives\" and \"complete cross screen measurement\" came out of executive mouths.\"We've built proprietary algorithms,\" Mr. Koonin boasted, because these days if you want to lay claim to being innovative and savvy, the word \"algorithm\" is the way to do it.Some of theater and film's greatest works have been built on these defining dynamics of the upfronts the vulnerable clown, the aging protagonist who is trying to convey that he's still relevant. Charlie Chaplin. \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\" Dare we say \"King Lear?Yes, the upfronts, beneath all the red carpet nonsense and noisy video collages, are sublime performance art, as rich in pathos as they are in dazzle. They are about survival, the most gripping drama of all. One of the zillion film clips in those infernal collages was for a new TNT series, \"The Last Ship,\" about a destroyer that, after four months of radio silence, emerges into a world that has been ravaged by a pandemic.\"Our mission now is simple,\" one character says. \"Stay alive until they find that cure.\""}
{"_id": 10, "text": "Before Amazon, Hulu and Netflix started soaking up all the oxygen in the streaming video world, other companies were trying to establish themselves as purveyors of television quality original Web shows.One that has survived, and is still in there swinging, is Crackle. Backed by the deep pockets of Sony Pictures Entertainment, it's been around since, offering episodes of Sony distributed television series like \"Seinfeld,\" \"Damages\" and \"Rescue Me\" and short form original series like \"The Bannen Way\" and Jerry Seinfeld's \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\"This year, though, Crackle has turned its attention to longer shows. And with a couple of new series and a feature length film, its 2013 output is actually on a par with the amount of truly original content released by its better publicized competitors .That isn't to argue that the Crackle shows \"Cleaners,\" a violent action comedy starring Emmanuelle Chriqui and Gina Gershon \"Chosen,\" a thriller starring Milo Ventimiglia and \"Extraction,\" a commando action film with Danny Glover and Sean Astin have been unduly neglected. Compared with Netflix series like \"Orange Is the New Black\" or \" House of Cards,\" they're several cuts below in quality and polish. At least three cuts. Maybe four.But next to Hulu shows like \"The Awesomes\" and \"Quick Draw,\" they look pretty good. And they're ahead of Amazon, where \" Alpha House \" and \"Betas\" still exist only as pilots. As perfectly competent, occasionally inspired B grade genre entertainment, they stand up well alongside the second tier of basic cable drama History, Hallmark, Lifetime.The newest Crackle offering is \"Cleaners,\" whose six 30 minute episodes (that includes commercials) went up this month. The first full length project written and directed by Paul Leyden, a longtime soap opera actor (\"As the World Turns, \"Cleaners\" is a tribute to the enduring influence of Quentin Tarantino. There's something comforting in seeing \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" so lovingly simulated two decades later.In keeping with the early '90s ambience, there's also an element of \"Thelma Louise.\" Ms. Chriqui and Emily Osment play Veronica and Roxie, a pair of gorgeous but down to earth hit women and problem solvers. They're defined by their work outfits the square Veronica wears a plain gray T shirt over her black sports bra, while the cool Roxie goes for colorful little tanks over fluorescent pink.\"Cleaners\" is full of post Tarantino, Hong Kong derived window dressing the split screens the jumpy, stuttering editing the cuts and dissolves with their own sound effects (gunshots, clashing blades) but Mr. Leyden has contrived a reasonably clever story in which the lethal heroines suddenly find themselves recast as the protectors of a boy who's been kidnapped. As the women bicker and tend to each other's wounds, they're helped by a clean cut, square jawed F.B.I. agent (David Arquette, in an amusing bit of casting, while being pursued by their boss, Mother (Gina Gershon, and her No. 1 killer, Julian (Clifton Collins Jr.).The show occasionally loses momentum the arch, jokey dialogue sometimes sags and, most disappointing of all, it's not as much fun as you would think watching Ms. Gershon play the sexy mom leader of a group of hired killers. But there are compensations, particularly Ms. Osment's amusing, entirely disarming performance. And Mr. Leyden comes up with as many nifty lines as he does clunkers, like Julian's lament after a long session of \"noninvasive\" torture, \"Either he's the toughest 8 year old on the planet, or he doesn't know where the money is.\"\"Extraction,\" written and directed by Tony Giglio (\"Death Race Inferno\") and posted last month, is a thoroughly routine, video game style low budget actioner in the Michael Bay mold, starring a somewhat blank actor named John Foo as a special ops soldier on a botched operation in a Chechen prison. The window dressing consists of recognizable faces like Mr. Glover and Mr. Astin, running the operation from America Joanne Kelly of \"Warehouse,\" ferreting out a traitor and the always amusing Vinnie Jones, growling and gnashing his teeth as a sadistic Anglo Russian prison warden.\"Cleaners\" and \"Extraction\" may span a spectrum from moderate to mediocre. But if you're the sort of viewer who's inclined to watch these kinds of things on Syfy or Spike, they could be another argument for cutting the cable cord."}
{"_id": 10, "text": "Sooner or later, everything old is new again, especially on television. In a season when the Hollywood gene pool teems with fresh specimens, some familiar faces are shaking things up, defying stereotypes and showing those newbies how it's done. Mid glorious career, four veteran actors are revealing different sides of themselves. Maybe we don't know them as well as we thought we did.Last month, Margo Martindale and her husband, William Boals, drove from their home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, pulled into Los Angeles seven days later with their dog, looked at each other and almost started to cry.\"We sat in this beautiful yard with this beautiful pool and thought, 'Now what?' \" she recalled.The couple had changed coasts after Ms. Martindale was cast on the CBS sitcom \"The Millers,\" starring Will Arnett as a roving television reporter whose divorce prompts his father (Beau Bridges) to leave his mother (Ms. Martindale. When Mom who can't understand why everyone isn't as smitten with her as she is suddenly moves in with Son, two's most definitely a crowd.With \"The Millers\" Ms. Martindale is satisfying her good girl yearning after a spate of characters like Mags Bennett on \"Justified.\" Playing that \"real smart, shrewd redneck killer,\" in her words, earned her an Emmy. \"It was,\" said Ms. Martindale, \"as if I'd stepped into something I had been meant to play most of my life.\"After originating the role of Truvy in the 1987 Off Broadway production of \"Steel Magnolias,\" Ms. Martindale, now, assumed she'd end up in sitcoms until fate and a Manhattan Theater Club producer sent her down a more dramatic road. She is up for an Emmy this year for her portrayal of a Soviet spymaster in \"The Americans\" on FX .\"It's fun to come back to comedy,\" she said. \"It's like stagecraft. You are playing to an audience.\" And the other day, when she got a laugh where she didn't expect it? \"It was like, 'Whoa, yeah!' \"You won't hear him screaming \"Stella!\" in his latest role, although he does yell a lot. But Blair Underwood might never have portrayed Robert Ironside had Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, not seen his turn as Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" on Broadway last year.The result was \"Ironside,\" a retooling of the 1967 Raymond Burr drama, this time starring Mr. Underwood as a New York City police detective paralyzed from the waist down after being shot. Flashbacks to an able bodied Ironside unravel the mystery of what went wrong two years earlier, and why his former partner (Brent Sexton) still has nightmares.Describing both Kowalski and Ironside as aggressive and animalistic, Mr. Underwood, 49, said each role \"can be straightforward and mercurial and volcanic but also very vulnerable all at once.\" He continued, \"I've played that character in independent films and onstage, but I haven't done him a lot in mainstream television,\" where he's still perhaps best remembered as the cocky charmer Jonathan Rollins on NBC's \"L.A. Law.\"Then there's the challenge of learning to maneuver through life in a wheelchair, something he has watched his mother, who has multiple sclerosis, do for more than a decade. \"It takes repetition and making yourself comfortable in that character as much as possible, and to that end it's about being emotionally and psychologically connected to someone who deals with that every day,\" said Mr. Underwood, who got help on that from his technical adviser, David Bryant, who has been paralyzed for more than 30 years. \"Like his girlfriend said, 'He wears his chair.' \"Oh, those eyes. It's a rare fan who hasn't dreamed of swimming in Michael Ealy's limpid pools. As blue and warm as the Caribbean, that gaze seized hearts and corrupted wills in \"Think Like a Man,\" the film adapted from Steve Harvey's relationship advice book, with a sequel in the works, and Showtime's \"Sleeper Cell,\" for which Mr. Ealy earned a Golden Globe nomination as an F.B.I. agent who infiltrates a group of Islamic terrorists .So how did Mr. Sensitivity end up being cast as an android?"}
{"_id": 10, "text": "SAN FRANCISCO Around midnight on Thursday in the Mission district here, Dave Chappelle was standing onstage in a converted church called the Chapel when a member of the packed audience yelled, \"Why make a comeback?\"Looking fit in a casual black shirt, Mr. Chappelle, a 39 year old father of three, repeated the question, took a drag from his clove cigarette and leaned into a punch line with emphatic exasperation \"Private school is expensive!\" Then he flashed a sneaky grin, clunked his microphone on his belly and scampered upstage the way he used to in the opening moments of his old series, \"Chappelle's Show.\"Later in his magnetically compelling set, which ran nearly two hours, he returned to the subject with a more sober perspective. \"I don't need to come back,\" he said, pausing. \"But why not?\"After mocking a drunk woman who requested that he perform old characters, he struck a wearier tone. \"This is a hard context to be funny in,\" he said. \"What's the point?\"To the general public, Dave Chappelle seems like the J. D. Salinger of comedy . Since he quit his Comedy Central show after two brilliant seasons, walking away in 2005 from a reported 50 million contract, his mystique has grown as his public profile has shrunk. He rarely gives interviews or makes television appearances. It's been many years since he released a movie or taped a comedy special. Persistent rumors of a high profile return, perhaps on a comedy supertour with Chris Rock, have grown louder.Seeing Mr. Chappelle here revealed him as struggling with some of the issues that led him to leave the spotlight. It's also an exhilarating reminder of what we've been missing the laid back delivery pivoting into explosive bursts of energy the sideways insight and deadpan gravitas how every joke seems as if he came up with it on the spot. If there are comics with more onstage charisma than Dave Chappelle, I haven't seen them.Perched on a stool, he talked to his listeners as if they were old friends, so at ease that they frequently talked back. This became a dialogue that often turned raucous, but even when the room spun out of control, the heckler earning angry responses, Mr. Chappelle looked calm, even pleased with the comedic possibilities.\"It's like flying coach in here,\" Mr. Chappelle said, in one of many knowing jokes that skewers his success.He even poked fun at his own Hamlet like thought process. \"I was talking to Mos Def,\" he said in an aside, \"and I knew he wasn't listening because I was talking about my comeback.\"A reason that Mr. Chappelle has not lost a step is that he's nowhere near as reclusive as he seems. He just performs only on his terms in small rooms, on short notice . He was to play two more shows Monday night in San Francisco . He recently did a week of drop ins at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles .In February he showed up at the Comedy Cellar in New York, performing with Mr. Rock. As reported by the Web site the Comic's Comic, Mr. Rock said he needed time to prepare his set, adding \"Dave's like Let's just do it Wednesday. Unannounced.\"Tracking down Mr. Chappelle has become a comedy nerd pastime that requires close attention to social media and a willingness to drop everything and go. I heard about the shows here on Twitter the day before, bought one of the last tickets online and jumped on a plane. The show, the second of the night for him, was clearly not intended as a polished set. Comparing notes with audience members who had seen him before, I thought that it was more off the cuff, improvisational.When Mr. Chappelle left his series, he said he felt uncomfortable when a white crew member laughed at a sketch about black stereotypes. On Thursday he didn't ignore the way he departed so much as muse on it indirectly, without bitterness. Whether it was sex or race or politics, the subject matter of his comedy was always more familiar than his take on it. Mr. Chappelle still covers that territory, but his material also now seems more personal, even confessionalControlling the context of comedy, an increasingly complex subject in the age of social media, was also a theme of the night. He explained he would do gay jokes in San Francisco because the audience would get the intent, but not in Mississippi . He also spent a perceptive minute or so analyzing and applauding how Quentin Tarantino handled the issue of black characters selling out their race in \" Django Unchained .\"None of this is to say that the show was sober. It was consistently funny. Remarking on the feat of building the Great Wall of China, he marveled, tongue in cheek, \"I didn't know they had Mexicans.\" He demonstrated a craftsman's skill in his setups, but it's in his rambling yarns that Mr. Chappelle distinguished himself.Like Bill Cosby, another stand up who likes to sit down, Mr. Chappelle has an eccentric delivery so distinctive and a persona so appealing that he doesn't need to tell jokes to get a laugh. But instead of abusing this gift, he exploits it.The highlight of the evening was a story about visiting New York during the Occupy Wall Street protests . \"I had my own protests,\" he said. \"It was called 'Occupy Luxury Suite.' \"Then, after confessing that he was feeling down, he said he saw a homeless man outside his hotel digging through garbage. He lingered on this image, describing it in vivid detail, explaining that this man was attacking his job with such intensity that it was as if he were searching for \"the next big thing.\"Then the homeless man saw Mr. Chappelle, and their eyes met, a connection. It was then, Mr. Chappelle said, that he realized that he was the next big thing. The instant after this sentimental moment, he shifted into panic and yelled wildly at the homeless man, \"You stink!\" and ran away.It's tempting to read this tale as a metaphor for his career (with show business as the searching homeless man, but what matters more is that it was a funny story beautifully told. And it was only the first act of an involved set piece that included sharp self parody, suspense and the casual poetry of a born storyteller. Let's hope its real meaning is this Dave Chappelle is just getting started."}
{"_id": 10, "text": "The terror gripping broadcast television as viewers continue to run away.6 million to \" Duck Dynasty,\" 13.1 million to \"The Bible,\" who knows how many to \" House of Cards \" has meant boom times for TV's most ephemeral product the network pilot.The big five networks have ordered nearly 100 pilot episodes for the 2013 fall season, up significantly from last year, when everyone was talking about how many pilots there were. Right now they are being cast and shot at a furious pace so that the fall schedules can be announced in May, and, as always, a great majority of them will be seen by no one but the people who make them and the programmers who reject them.All that we know about these embryonic series are the names involved and the plot descriptions, but that's enough to dream on. Who wouldn't have wanted to see \"Downwardly Mobile \" last fall on NBC, with Roseanne Barr and John Goodman running a trailer park? O.K., maybe not you. Does it change your mind to know that it would have kept \"Guys With Kids\" or \"The New Normal\" off the air?Without pretending to know which projects have the best chance of success beyond the Michael J. Fox sitcom already picked up by NBC and the latest \"NCIS\" spinoff at CBS here are eight pilots that are intriguing for one reason or another a star, a writer, a director, a premise. Will they be any good? We'll probably never know.ABOUT A BOY ( NBC ) Nick Hornby's novel, which already spawned a film starring Hugh Grant, now gives birth to a comedy pilot directed by Jon Favreau, with the always on the verge actor David Walton (\"Perfect Couples,\" \"Bent\") as the jerk waiting to be reformed. The attraction here Jason Katims of \" Friday Night Lights\" and \"Parenthood\" wrote the pilot.BELIEVE ( NBC ) Major filmmakers like Jonathan Demme, Phillip Noyce and Martin Scorsese have directed TV pilots in recent years, but it's still exciting that Alfonso Cuar n is involved in writing and directing this drama about a convict chosen to protect a superpowered 10 year old girl. It sounds like a good match for Mr. Cuar n, who has made some of the most darkly enchanting movies about childhood of the last 20 years \"A Little Princess,\" \"Great Expectations\" and \" Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" the best of the films in that series. (Even the great sexual coming of age tale \"Y Tu Mam Tambi n\" was about teenage boys .)An unknown actress with the noticeable name Johnny Sequoyah will play the girl. One of the producers is J. J. Abrams, which increases the chances of a pickup, though his attention is split between \"Believe\" and an untitled science fiction show at Fox that crosses \"Robocop\" with \"Blade Runner.\" BEVERLY HILLS COP ( CBS ) This could easily be terrible, but the idea of Eddie Murphy once again playing Axel Foley now the father of a Beverly Hills cop (Brandon T. Jackson) in a pilot written by Shawn Ryan of \"The Shield\" is pretty irresistible. This makes the list over \"Crazy Ones\" ( CBS, the David E. Kelley pilot starring Mr. Murphy's fellow geriatric stand up star Robin Williams .BOOMERANG ( FOX ) The spies in plain sight genre may be about played out, but this one sounds like fun Felicity Huffman (\"Desperate Housewives\") and Anthony LaPaglia (\"Without a Trace\") as the heads of a family of government employed assassins . John Wells (\"Southland,\" \"ER\") is one of the producers, and the director is the talented Craig Brewster (\"Hustle and Flow.HOSTAGES ( CBS ) The distinguished Australian actress Toni Collette (\" The United States of Tara\") takes another stab at American television, this time with just one personality that of a surgeon whose family is kidnapped just before she operates on the president. Other bright spots in the cast include Tate Donovan, Dylan McDermott and James Naughton. On the other hand, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer production, which augurs a certain breathless conventionality.MOM ( CBS ) Allison Janney plays Anna Faris's mother both ends of that equation sound pretty enticing. Chuck Lorre is the writer of this comedy, which could be good (\" The Big Bang Theory \") or bad (\"Two and a Half Men.RAKE ( FOX ) Greg Kinnear could have a lot of fun as the disreputable, adulterous, tax dodging lawyer in this drama based on a popular Australian series. Peter Tolan (\"Rescue Me,\" \"The Larry Sanders Show\") is writing the pilot with Peter Duncan, creator of the original.UNTITLED D.J. NASH PROJECT ( NBC ) One of TV's best character actors, J. K. Simmons (\"The Closer,\" \"Oz, gets a chance to headline in this comedy about divorced parents raising a son. His ex wife is played by Parker Posey, whose eccentrically flinty persona has never found a long term home on television. Mr. Nash's background includes writing and producing for \"Hank,\" \" 'Til Death\" and \"Traffic Light.\""}

{"_id": 11, "text": "DENVER The Meadowlark isn't exactly the big time. It's a brick and stone walled basement club, capacity, with a bar occupying half the room and a barely raised stage where three's a crowd. Sipping a 2 Bud Light during a happy hour in January, Wesley Schultz, the singer and guitarist in the Lumineers, fondly looked the place over.Not so long ago, in, he recalled, the Lumineers would play the Meadowlark's open mike night \"every Tuesday religiously .\" At that point the Lumineers were the songwriting team of Mr. Schultz on guitar and the drummer Jeremiah Fraites, usually just shaking a tambourine. (Mr. Fraites had already begun wearing his trademark suspenders.)The Meadowlark was a gathering place for the musicians in Denver's close knit music scene a place where the Lumineers would run into local folk pop heroes like the songwriter Nathaniel Rateliff and the band Paper Bird. And there, two songs at a time, the Lumineers were building the local following that would begin the band's momentum toward its current Top 10 single, \"Ho Hey,\" and two nominations at Sunday's Grammy Awards, for best new artist and best Americana album.A few days later the Lumineers were in New York, rehearsing for \" Saturday Night Live .\" At NBC's Studio 8H Mr. Fraites dismissed the band's chances at being named best new artist the other nominees are Alabama Shakes, Fun., Frank Ocean and Hunter Hayes.\"We're not going to win,\" he said, though he was slightly more optimistic about the Americana nomination. \"But the exposure will help sell more tickets to shows, and hopefully people will hear the whole album and give us a little bit more longevity in this business .\"With its folksy guitar and its foot stamping, tambourine driven beat \"Ho Hey\" arrived as a startling anomaly in the pop Top, where it's surrounded by Auto Tuned voices and electronic beats. Mumford Sons, the English band that decisively re established folk rock as a commercial force with their 2009 album \"Sigh No More,\" didn't breach the pop Top 20 with that album's biggest hit, \"The Cave.\" But \"Ho Hey,\" with its chanted hos and heys and its deceptively upbeat chorus Mr. Schultz wrote \"I belong with you You belong with me\" in the unhappy aftermath of a breakup has reclaimed pop radio for the acoustic and the hand played. It's one more hint of a pendulum swing back toward naturalism in pop.\"It's really short and catchy, and people can remember it after they've heard it once or twice,\" said John Ivey, senior vice president for programming at Clear Channel Media and Entertainment and program director of KIIS FM in Los Angeles, which was among the first Top 40 stations to pick up \"Ho Hey\" after the song conquered the radio format called alternative. \"We obviously do research, and it was a really popular record, and we felt like it was worth a shot just to see if it was palatable with our listeners. Top 40 has always come down to the song, and this is just a cool song.\"The Lumineers' self titled debut album was released in April, and over the last nine months the Lumineers now a five member band have been almost continuously on tour as their gigs have grown from club dates to the opening slot at Dave Matthews's arena shows. When the Lumineers headlined the New Year's Eve show at the Ogden Theater here, the governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, was in the audience. \"Wes Schultz had them completely in the palm of his hand,\" the governor said in a telephone interview .The Lumineers' success their album has sold about,000 copies leveraged Denver's cozy, supportive local scene with East Coast ambition. Until Mr. Schultz and Mr. Fraites picked up and moved to Denver, the Lumineers had been, in Mr. Schultz's blunt term, a \"failure.\"Mr. Schultz and Mr. Fraites grew up in Ramsey, N.J. and have been writing together since. Along the way, Mr. Schultz said, he changed from being a wordy singer songwriter to prizing melody first.\"Your melodies make people want to hear what you're saying,\" he said. \"They've got to be open to hearing it, almost hum it. And if they want to go deeper there is something there.\"Trying to get noticed they played open mike nights in New York City and aspired, in vain, to move up to the small clubs on the Lower East Side . \"We always wanted to play the Living Room, or Pianos, or the Mercury Lounge, but we never got anywhere close to that,\" Mr. Fraites said. \"We thought that was like Madison Square Garden .\""}
{"_id": 11, "text": "BOISE, Idaho The pounding on his cargo van doors started as soon as Jalan Crossland 's head hit the pillow. After a thousand miles of rough road and his fifth straight night onstage, the bone tired banjo man had kicked off his boots and collapsed on the mattress in his old Dodge 3500 outside Pengilly's, the saloon here where he and his fellow musicians had jammed well into the early morning .Roused by the adrenaline jolt of his \"Big Horn Mountain Blues,\" the bluegrass closer of his touring show, some of his more ardent and well lubricated fans weren't buying the idea that he was allowed to retire for the evening. Mr. Crossland, 43, affectionately known in his home state, Wyoming, as the \"trailer park troubadour,\" had half a mind to wave the.38 pistol he keeps nearby when sleeping on the road. Instead he fired up his rig and headed for a reliably quiet spot to crash \"A Walmart parking lot or Flying J truck stop you'll always get a good night's sleep there,\" he said.Mr. Crossland's choice of accommodations was dictated by personal preference and the hardscrabble economics of the WYOamericana Caravan, a 14 date swing through the heart of the rugged American West featuring three popular Wyoming bands. This monthlong \"traveling concert circus\" wound down this month after treating juke joint crowds in Colorado, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming to a buoyant mix of bluegrass, rock, folk, and old timey music. Joining Mr. Crossland, who hails from the town of Ten Sleep and drove solo, were J Shogren Shanghai'd, a trio from Centennial, and Screen Door Porch, a quartet from Jackson.The tour was brainstormed and organized by Seadar Rose, who shares singer songwriter duties with her husband, Aaron Davis, in Screen Door Porch. (Their alt country band also includes the bass player Tom Davidson and the drummer Andy Peterson.) Aiming to present a showcase of Wyoming roots music both inside and beyond the least populous state's borders, she wrangled commitments from club owners, started a promotional Web site, designed posters, solicited sponsorships from merchants (suggested donation cash or beer) and recruited advance people at each stop to spread word of the caravan's impending arrival.\"We all like each other and each other's music,\" said Ms. Rose, 31, \"and always thought it would be cool to tour together. So rather than wait for some promoter to step in, we said, 'Let's just bootstrap the thing, do it ourselves.' After all, that's how we do everything else in Wyoming .\"The caravan's grass roots style of self promotion reflects a growing trend. \"I'm seeing more and more artists who don't have an agent or publicist but are finding creative ways to tour,\" said Valerie Denn, a booking agent in Austin, Tex. As examples, she cites Dave Barnes, master of the \"barnjo\" (a hard body electric banjo, whose coming itinerary takes him through Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan, and the Denver based singer songwriter Megan Burtt, who will be appearing at clubs in Colorado, California and Texas .\"Bands are pooling their resources, coming up with unusual packaging ideas,\" Ms. Denn said. \"They're using social media to raise money, find free places to stay on the road or do house concerts between tour dates so they can pick up a little cash and sell some CDs. Crowdsourcing is the new norm among independent bands.\"An artist's fan base is critical to this evolving strategy.\"Today's music lovers may not be willing to pay a lot for recorded music, but they do want a direct connection to bands they like,\" said Panos Panay, founder of the Web site sonicbids.com, which connects musicians with promoters, booking agents and retailers . \"They want to contribute to artists' development, so they'll donate money to help finance tours and recordings. Smart new bands are tapping into that by being more proactive in marketing their own brand.\"Besides Ms. Rose and her entrepreneurial gumption, the Wyoming caravan had the advantage of a renowned numbers man on board . When he's not growling the lyrics to irreverent tunes like \"Hand Grenade\" (\"When my Tommy gun starts burpin' Satan will be a hurtin' \") Jason Shogren, the lead singer and songwriter in J Shogren Shanghai'd (the latter term a reference to how he strong arms musicians into his band, holds down a day job as chairman of the economics department at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie. An expert on biodiversity and climate change, he prefers to tinker with equations more relevant to what he considers his real job.\"You know how many hits you need on Spotify to make the minimum wage each month?\" he asks, referring to the popular music downloading service. \"More than four million .\"More impressively, he's among the few pop musicians who have been party to a Nobel Peace Prize. After serving a year in the Clinton White House's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Shogren was appointed to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, which shared a Nobel with Al Gore in. He was deemed a party to the award along with,500 others who have served on the panel . \"I've got the little plastic keychain thingy with a picture of Alfred Nobel to prove it,\" he said. \"But I was never invited to any party .\"Not that his professorial cred ranks very high with his tour mates, who include the drummer and guitarist Jascha Herdt and the bass player Shaun Kelley.\"No one would want my advice even if I were dumb enough to offer it,\" said Mr. Shogren, 54, an affable bear of a man with a beard and searing blue eyes who has recorded four albums since. \"Seadar and Aaron are the ringleaders I'm just along for the ride. Jalan is the real star here.\""}
{"_id": 11, "text": "For all but the most knowledgeable pop music fans, Jay Z's three minute commercial during the N.B.A. finals last Sunday might have been perplexing. The black and white spot showed a rumpled Jay Z working on music in a studio. Its documentary style created the impression the viewer was eavesdropping on a session as the rapper talked with producers in poetic terms about an album. It ended with a cryptic text message on screen, \"The Next Big Thing Is Here\" and below it the Web site magnacartaholygrail.com.At the site it becomes clear that \" Magna Carta Holy Grail \" is the title of a new album, and that the commercial was, in effect, Jay Z's announcement of its release on July 4 under an arrangement with Samsung. The company will give away the first million copies to owners of its cellphones through an app .The mysterious tone of the ad and the secrecy surrounding the making of the album are in keeping with recent trends in music marketing. In the last six months, several major artists David Bowie, Daft Punk and Kanye West have kept their new albums under wraps, then mounted brief, intense campaigns aimed not at critics and radio programmers, but at generating waves of interest on the Internet, banking on their fans to pass along news.Such viral marketing isn't new. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, for instance, concocted an elaborate online scavenger hunt involving codes on T shirts and songs left on flash drives in bathrooms at his concerts to promote his 2007 album \"Year Zero.\" But the recent examples are bigger in scale and ambition and seem to underscore what marketing experts see as two trends the decline of record sales as part of the overall income of musicians and the rise of the artist as a branded commodity .A musician's interaction with fans, they say, has become a form of entertainment itself that drives sales of merchandise and concert tickets as well as corporate sponsorships. Jay Z's decision to let Samsung buy the first million copies of his record at a discounted price and give them away is bound to boost his personal brand.\"It ain't like there is a lot of money in selling records anyway,\" said Steve Stoute, founder of the marketing agency Translation LLC. \"If the music is shared and people like it, you are going to make the money on tour.\"Mike King, who teaches marketing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, said that teasing fans with tidbits, creating a sense of mystery and letting Internet buzz do the marketing, circumvents the critics and the major media outlets that used to set the agenda. Once, \"it was 'How can you engage with the gatekeepers?' \" he said. \"Now it's 'How do you remove these gatekeepers and go directly to the fans?' \"But marketing experts say this approach works best with established acts who have a large online following. Errol Kolosine, who teaches music business and marketing at New York University, said, \"When you as an artist reach a point where your brand is as valuable as any label, then you are at the point where you can call your shots.\"Mr. Stoute said viral marketing taps into the treasure hunting instinct fans display when they scour the Internet for pirated tracks. Musicians have learned that news passed from fan to fan can be more powerful than a review in a major publication. \"The marketing of music today has been informed by the process of how music was stolen, \" he said. \"Everybody figured out through the hard route that once there is buzz on a song it's going to be shared at an intense rate.\"Most albums are still marketed the old fashioned way with labels distributing promotional copies to journalists and other tastemakers ahead of a release. Then theyissue a single to radio stations a month or so before the album, looking for a hit to attract people. And the musician does interviews and makes radio and TV appearances to generate publicity.That paradigm seems to be changing or undergoing variations, at least with big artists. David Bowie, for instance, kept his new album, two years in the making, a secret until Jan. 8 (his birthday. Then, without fanfare, he released the single \"Where Are They Now?\" and posted a surreal music video on YouTube . He did no interviews, though it was his first album in a decade. Instead, he plastered London and other cities with posters showing the album cover, a guerrilla campaign more fitting for a DIY punk band than a major star. Then he posted a second video for the single \"The Stars Are Out,\" starring Tilda Swinton. Daft Punk, the French electronic duo famous for their robot headgear, also gave few hints that they planned to release an album in May. The first clue came in February when they posted a picture of their helmets fused together on Facebook, along with the logo of their label, Columbia Records. Over the next two months, they tantalized audiences with enigmatic billboards and Saturday Night Live spots and played the entire album at a small fair in rural Australia, posted interviews on YouTube and showed a 60 second ad at the Coachella Music festival .By the time the single \"Get Lucky\" was released to radio on April, the online buzz was in high gear, said Scott Greer, Columbia's vice president for marketing . \"We were trying to reveal as little as possible,\" he said. Kanye West was also coy about his new release, \"Yeezus.\" He sent a Twitter message to his fans on May 1 saying only \"June Eighteenth,\" which turned out to be the issue date for the album. Two weeks later, he had a video for one of the singles, \"New Slaves,\" projected on the outsides of buildings in 10 major cities around the world, alerting fans about the showings on Twitter . Thousands recorded the screenings on their phones and posted the images online .The next day, he appeared on \" Saturday Night Live \" and performed \"New Slaves\" and \"Black Skinhead.\" Before the release of \"Yeezus,\" he did only one traditional interview a long one with The New York Times . He skipped releasing a single to radio altogether.When the album finally leaked on the Internet four days before its release date, fans scrambled to get it. The record was on track to sell more than,000 copies this week.\"It was Kanye's vision to create intrigue and mystique around the project,\" said Steve Bartels, the president of Island Def Jam Music Group. \"Kanye always wanted to create a way for fans of music to be presented an album and his vision all at one time.\""}
{"_id": 11, "text": "Marian McPartland, who died on Tuesday at, was an erudite jazz pianist whose career stretched back to the heyday of 52nd Street. But she will be best remembered for \"Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz,\" the public radio show she hosted for more than 30 years, featuring duets and conversation with an array of musicians.Some of those guests, like Eubie Blake, were her elders, others her accomplished peers. And some grew up listening to the show. That was the case for Norah Jones, who was an aspiring jazz pianist in Texas before she moved to New York and made her name as a singer songwriter .Ms. Jones, 34, first appeared on \"Piano Jazz\" shortly after releasing her debut album, \"Come Away With Me\" (Blue Note, which earned eight Grammy Awards . \"It made me happy because I had listened to Marian for so long,\" she said. \"My mom and her ended up becoming friends, writing letters for the last 10 years.\"Speaking by phone from her apartment in Brooklyn, Ms. Jones reflected on both Ms. McPartland and the show. Here are some excerpts FIRST LISTEN My first exposure to Marian McPartland actually wasn't through \"Piano Jazz.\" When I was 14 or, my mom took me to a free concert in Dallas with Marian and her trio. I was already into jazz and going to a performing arts school. But up until then I hadn't seen a lot of women perform jazz, certainly no women instrumentalists. And to see this lady who was my grandmother's age up there, playing with a piano trio, was just the coolest thing I'd ever seen.I went to school that week, and I had a teacher, Kent Ellingson, who had every \"Piano Jazz\" show on cassette. So I dubbed all the tapes, and listened to almost all of them.PLAYING WITH HER I was actually on her show twice. I like how she would play one song herself, one of the artist's songs. She did that with me she played \"Don't Know Why\" and completely reharmonized it. And she'll let you play something, and then you get to play together.I was really nervous, but I wasn't nervous about her not being cool. She was just the most sweet, welcoming, motherly sweetheart polite, very British, but very warm. I remember her smile after we would finish a tune. You can kind of hear it on the radio. She says something like \"Uh! That was marvelous,\" and you could see it on her face. It was nice, after hearing those Marianisms on the radio, to be the recipient of one.My second \"Piano Jazz\" was at the Tanglewood Jazz Festival in. That show was probably one of the bigger shows we had done at the time. Yesterday I listened to that recording, and I sing so differently now. I still thought of myself as a jazz musician then. I really played that music I lived it and breathed it, even though my first album was not straight ahead jazz.WHAT SHE WAS LIKE A friend was recently telling me about some show that Marian did where the guest wasn't very respectful, and she took care of business . So maybe we should add that she was a tough broad, too.Playing jazz as a woman, back in the day, I'm sure it was hard for her. And that fact that she found this thing that she's so good at, and became really successful at age, that's awesome. I think music can keep you young, if you never stop using your mind in that way. That's what was so cool about her. She seemed genuinely excited about every guest, even to the end."}
{"_id": 11, "text": "NEWARK The costumes were all wrong for \"Andrea Ch nier.\" At the center of the action were men in white protective suits, not tailcoats and breeches, and they were aiming high pressure hoses at pieces of the set. Not one of them sang a note.This was not the Metropolitan Opera's usual \"Ch nier.\"In an out of the way parking lot here in what one Met official called \" 'Sopranos' country\" and he was not talking about the ones who sing the stagehands from the carpentry department were doing the Met's version of housecleaning, readying the backdrop of an opera that the house has not performed in six years.They offered a glimpse into the complex preparations that go into the Met's season, which begins on Sept. 23 with the first of 218 performances of 26 different operas. They also provided a reminder of the potential headaches and the expenses that come with running a repertory company that never performs the same opera two nights in a row.Ever since the last performance of \"Ch nier\" in, the sets have been packed in shipping containers in a storage yard owned by a trucking company called Daybreak Express, which shares its name with a Duke Ellington song. The Met has,300 containers at the yard, all air and water tight. \"Ch nier\" fills eight.\"We are their warehouse,\" John Scerbo, the executive vice president of Daybreak Express, said one day this week. \"If you were to put this stuff in a regular warehouse, you'd need over a million square feet .\"\"Ch nier\" is going back into the repertory this season, so the stage crew did what it does whenever the Met revives a production. Stagehands removed the locks on each container and checked for dust and damage. (Hence the protective gear.) Stephen Diaz, the Met's master carpenter, led the way into one container. The air was slightly musty.\"This is not bad,\" he said, \"but you have to get the smell out. Singers are sensitive to smell, especially the principals. You have to make sure they're comfortable.\"So the stage crew hauled the set into the parking lot, piece by piece . Someone turned on the hoses, spraying bleach and odor eliminator on columns and arches that were left to dry in the sun.The Met keeps the makings of about 100 different productions here sets broken down into pieces marked with instructions for speedy assembly at Lincoln Center . The containers for an opera are trucked to Lincoln Center just before it goes into rehearsal, and the sets remain at the Met until after the season's last performance of that opera. The Met has some backstage storage space Mr. Diaz said that he usually has the sets for four to seven operas on hand at any given time about 80 containers' worth.The Met, which struggled financially during the recession, will not say how much it pays for storage or transport. But the Met's repertory means that there are times when a marathon of trucks is coming and going, as the stage crew knocks down one set and takes in the next one. \"It is a 24 7 operation when they are in season,\" said Larry Pucciarello, who coordinates the logistics for Daybreak Express. \"They're on the phone 'Where's this truck? Where's that truck?' \"Only once in 30 years of what Mr. Diaz calls \"containerizing\" until the 1980s, the Met ran its own warehouse, in Weehawken, N.J. has a truck been stolen. In the 1990s, thieves broke into a depot, probably hoping for a load of televisions, not part of the set for \"Turandot.\" The stolen container was never found, said Mr. Diaz, who had to do an inventory of the 18 other containers to figure out what to replace before that \"Turandot\" could be staged again.The Met has thinned out its holdings in recent years, retaining only one production of most operas, although it has held on to multiple versions of a few for historical reasons or for their value, among them the Mark Chagall production of Mozart's \"Zauberfl te,\" which had its premiere in, during the Met's first season at Lincoln Center . But Mr. Diaz discarded the David Hockney sets for a 1990s production of that same opera after the staging by Julie Taymor went into the repertory nine years ago .Other containers hold the trappings of two \"Toscas,\" the classic Franco Zeffirelli version and the one by the French director Luc Bondy that replaced it in, and two \"Ring\" cycles. Pieces of the \"Ring\" machine, the problem plagued device that served as a set in the most recent staging of these four Wagner operas, were stored here after it was disassembled in May other components were sent to a climate controlled warehouse in Newburgh, N.Y.But the Met still has 25 containers loaded with the Otto Schenk \"Ring\" cycle, which first went into production in the 1980s. (It is now on the list of productions to be disposed of, but it is not clear how soon that will happen.)Mr. Diaz said the storage yard had \" long term positions and short term positions.\" Referring to Mr. Scerbo of Daybreak Express, he explained the difference \"I send him an opera that we're not doing for five years, he goes long term . An opera like 'Boh me,' that we'll do every year, he'll go short term .\"Until the Met moved to Lincoln Center from Broadway and 39th Street in, it stored its sets in the open, propping them against the Seventh Avenue side of the house. When it rained, the sets could get wet, or at least damp.With the move uptown, \"the intention was to have the whole season's repertory in the building at the beginning of the season,\" Mr. Diaz said. Most of the sets in those days were flat and could be rolled up now, almost all the sets are three dimensional, and cannot be.\"One of the larger shows there was 'Madame Butterfly,' \" Mr. Diaz said, \"which was one of the smallest shows here.\" The \"Butterfly\" that migrated to Lincoln Center and remained in the repertory until 1993 filled two storage containers. The Anthony Minghella \"Butterfly\" that had its premiere at the Met in 2006 takes eight."}
{"_id": 11, "text": "The machine is coming back to the Metropolitan Opera, which plans to mount a revival of Robert Lepage's high tech, polarizing and glitch prone \"Ring\" cycle in the 2018 19 season to showcase its next Br nnhilde the soprano Christine Goerke. She was offered the role after her breakout success last week in Strauss's fairy tale opera \"Die Frau Ohne Schatten.\"Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said he decided to cast Ms. Goerke as Br nnhilde after hearing her sing the role of the Dyer's Wife on Thursday in \"Frau a portrayal that was greeted with what he called \"one of the great ovations I have heard in recent years at the Met\" and that won lavish praise from several leading critics.\"After she sang in 'Frau' the other night, it just made me realize that we'd better invite her sooner rather than later,\" Mr. Gelb said in an interview. \"Because I don't want anybody else stealing her from us.\"Ms. Goerke's portrayal of the Dyer's Wife which she will repeat several times this month was hailed as a \"breakthrough night\" by Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times . Alex Ross, a critic for The New Yorker, wrote on his blog that \"she proved herself the most potent dramatic soprano to appear at the Met since well, let's not jinx her by naming names.\" The Met's orchestra posted a note of congratulations about the huge ovation to Ms. Goerke on Twitter where her handle is HeldenMommy writing, \"That was a ROAR.\"Mr. Gelb's announcement dispelled any lingering doubts about whether the Met would bring back Mr. Lepage's 16 million \"Ring,\" which featured dazzling projections, stunt doubles and what came to be known as \"the machine a,000 pound set of 24 long planks that rotated around an axis and had a stubborn habit of creaking and, at times, of malfunctioning.It was a polarizing production, so vast in scale that its ups and downs were chronicled in a documentary, \"Wagner's Dream.\" Critics gave it decidedly mixed reviews. Mr. Tommasini called it \"frustrating,\" praising breathtaking moments but warning that many of the effects were not worth the distractions they created. Mr. Ross called it \"the most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history.\"But Mr. Gelb said that while the production was disliked by some critics, he believed that large segments of the public enjoyed it immensely. And he said that the production would be fine tuned, and possibly re engineered, \"to make sure it is functioning in tiptop shape when it returns, hopefully this time with its mechanism a little quieter than before.\"Ms. Goerke (pronounced GERK eh) is scheduled to sing Br nnhilde in Houston and in at least one other house before bringing the role to the Met. The Met plans to cast her in several major parts in the coming seasons, Mr. Gelb said, including the title roles in Puccini's \"Turandot\" and Strauss's \"Elektra\" and the role of Ortrud in Wagner's \"Lohengrin,\" for which they plan to revive the stylized Robert Wilson production.\"We're really looking at her as kind of the go to dramatic soprano for these big Strauss Wagnerian roles,\" Mr. Gelb said.Although the deal to cast Ms. Goerke as Br nnhilde was essentially made on Friday after Sarah Billinghurst, the Met's assistant manager for artistic affairs, called Ms. Goerke's manager she did not learn of it until Monday, when she received the news at the Metropolitan Opera Guild's luncheon celebrating James Levine's return to the Met.\"I am overjoyed,\" Ms. Goerke, 44, said in a brief interview, just minutes after she had heard that she had been asked. \"I said 'Oh, that's interesting please tell him yes! And thank you so much!' \"For Ms. Goerke, the chance to sing one of the most celebrated and challenging dramatic soprano roles will be a milestone. She was part of the Met's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program in the 1990s, won the Richard Tucker Award in, and initially made a name for herself singing Handel and Mozart. After having some vocal problems a decade ago, which she spoke about in an interview with Opera News, she worked on a new technique and emerged as a major dramatic soprano.The first time she sang Wagner, she said, it was as the Third Norn in \"G tterd mmerung,\" conducted by Mr. Levine, weaving the rope of destiny until it breaks at the beginning of the opera.\"You know, we busted our rope and skulked offstage, but in fact, while the other two were in their dressing rooms, I was just standing on the side of the stage, listening to the Prologue, just thinking, 'Some day, some day, some day,' \" she recalled. \"And holy moly, some day is here.\"Mr. Levine praised Ms. Goerke at the Opera Guild lunch, where she sang \"O don fatale\" from Verdi's \"Don Carlo,\" filling in at the last moment for Dolora Zajick, who was indisposed.\"Did you hear that first performance of 'Frau' the other night?\" he asked, during his remarks. \"If you didn't, run, do not walk, to hear one, at least one.\" He said that her emergence as a dramatic soprano \"just thrills me to bits.\"But she did not seem to have many prima donna airs. When some gusts of air conditioning sent sheets of music in disarray as Craig Rutenberg, the Met's director of music administration, accompanied the bass baritone Eric Owens on the piano, Ms. Goerke jumped onto the stage. With no fuss, she served as Mr. Rutenberg's page turner."}
{"_id": 11, "text": "Thomas Ad s's operatic version of \"The Tempest,\" which had its premiere in 2004 at the Royal Opera House in London and arrived at the Metropolitan Opera last fall, was conceived as a capital M Masterpiece three acts, big cast, full chorus, Shakespearean source.Its ambitions are grand, and there is a great deal of sheer pleasure in its surging, glinting orchestral score. But many of its beauties seem either disconnected from the development of character and plot or shackled by the relentlessly rhyming couplets of Meredith Oakes's libretto.Mr. Ad s has indeed written a masterpiece of contemporary music drama, but \"The Tempest\" isn't it. It is his first opera, the keener, funnier, sadder \"Powder Her Face,\" an intimate two act, four singer chamber work first performed at the Cheltenham Festival in England in, when he was just.On next Friday evening New York City Opera's new production, directed by Jay Scheib, opens at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . A semistaged version was performed at the academy in, but this will be New York's first full experience of a work that seems more precise and moving with each passing year, both cooler and more warming.Operas of a slightly earlier period that featured real life characters from the recent past like Philip Glass's \"Satyagraha\" (1980) and John Adams's \"Nixon in China \" (1987) and \"Death of Klinghoffer\" (1991) had chosen subjects of historical importance and seriousness. Mr. Ad s and his librettist, Philip Hensher, went with a far more trivial story about the fame and money hungry Margaret Whigham, whose 1963 divorce from the Duke of Argyll was pure tabloid fodder, focused on salacious accusations of her promiscuity.Mr. Ad s and Mr. Hensher imagined the piece as a kind of dreamscape told in flashbacks to its heroine's climb, scandal and descent into mental instability and penury. The opera begins near her end, in, with the duchess sick, poor and querulous, holed up in a hotel room she cannot pay for and assisted by her maid, an electrician and the hotel manager.These three take turns as the rest of the opera's characters the libretto indicates transformations like \" Hotel Manager as Duke \" and \"Electrician as Lounge Lizard.\" The Maid and the Electrician become rubberneckers at the divorce trial, veering with casual cruelty from opinion to opinion on the proceedings.The Hotel Manager gives a long monologue as the judge who condemns the Duchess as \"a Don Juan among women.\" At one point the Electrician plays a waiter on whom the Duchess very visibly (and while singing) performs fellatio, a sequence that gave the opera an air of notoriety that lingers to this day but is far more disconcerting than arousing, with brutal vocal lunges.Mr. Ad s's Duchess is an expressionist femme fatale in the tradition of Berg's Lulu and Janacek's Emilia Marty (in \"The Makropulos Case . But she is also, like the Marschallin in Strauss's \"Rosenkavalier,\" an aristocrat who faces aging with a bittersweet mixture of fear, humor and resignation.She is simultaneously risible and pitiable, and those sides come together in two tour de force arias, the first just after her trial. \"So that is all,\" it begins, with a repeated figure in the woodwinds and tremolos that pass through the strings under a sad vocal line that soars on the words \"I am still loved,\" then starts to fragment into angry declamation, prefiguring the Duchess's insanity with eerie slides in the strings and a postlude of heaves and clicks.In the final scene the Duchess, by this point living in a world of her memories, reflects on the servants who have worked for her over a long life, dwelling on her maid. \"She died,\" she whispers, setting off a low groan in the orchestra. A gentle melody in the strings and brasses rises to a fury as she throws a perfume bottle against the wall. \"Broken,\" she sings. \"It's broken. Gone. It's the last thing I had.\"The music of \"Powder Her Face,\" like that of \"The Tempest,\" manages to be eclectic in a way that never sounds like pastiche and always sounds like Ad s. Set into the spiky texture of much of the score, its occasional lilting snippets of 1930s style popular songs could, in other hands, be the stuff of simple minded parody. But Mr. Ad s always brings in an unexpected note, a destabilizing rhythm, a mood that won't stay put.It is a style in which one thing flows endlessly, effortlessly into the next, just as the characters constantly change their costumes and the staccato brass tweets at the end of the overture lead seamlessly into the Maid's laughter in the opening scene. The action consisting of the Duchess's memories or fantasies or both seems to flow too, often dreamily stretching out as it unfolds in a way that seems both ominous and tender, conveying the boredom of the Duchess's frenetic yet empty life without ever being boring.Mr. Ad s's Duchess may lack the stature of Philip Glass's Gandhi or John Adams's Nixon. But \"Powder Her Face\" is not merely frivolous, particularly not in.\"Fancy,\" the Maid as Waitress bitterly sings, with both wonder and anger, as she considers the Duchess. \"Fancy being rich.\"The Duchess counters after her trial, \"I do not care what lies are told about me by members of the middle classes .\"Since its premiere \"Powder Her Face\" has been known as an opera about tabloid culture and the transience of modern celebrity, and it certainly is that. But more clearly than ever it also comes across as a work about class resentment, about the coruscating, deadening effects of money . \"In the end,\" as the Maid and the Electrician sing, \"it evaporates into air.\"It is surely an appropriate piece for this time of income inequality, global economic depression, crisis in the euro zone and austerity in Britain, in the same way that the Met's 2011 revival of \"Satyagraha,\" with its message of political resistance, spoke strongly to a New York in the throes of Occupy Wall Street . \"Powder Her Face\" could not sound more different from Mr. Glass's opera, but it is just as relevant to a city and a moment."}
{"_id": 11, "text": "The director Steven Soderbergh and just about everyone associated with \"Behind the Candelabra,\" the new biographical film about Liberace, emphasized from the start that the movie was going to be about a love affair. A strange love affair, for sure more a sordid co dependency between Scott Thorson, a rootless young man, and Mr. Entertainment himself, Liberace, who was 40 years older.The much awaited film, starring Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Mr. Thorson, was shown on HBO on Sunday night (and continues its run on that channel and through HBO Go and HBO on Demand . As we were forewarned, not much attention is paid to Liberace the pianist or his attitude toward music. \"I love giving people a good time,\" Mr. Douglas's Liberace explains to Mr. Damon's Thorson soon after they meet. \"That's what I'm all about.\"There is an element of entertainment in all the performing arts . Liszt, at the height of his touring virtuoso period, took the trappings of the superstar to another dimension. Beatlemania had nothing over the Lisztomania that swept Europe in the early 1840s.But was there musical substance to Liberace's showmanship, at least in its early years? I am no expert on the subject because even as a young piano student I thought his flamboyant television persona and frilly playing were absurd.Still, \"Behind the Candelabra\" stirred my curiosity. I watched some videos of Liberace's early appearances, including a 1940s film segment of him playing \"The 12th Street Rag\" on a white grand piano for three adoring, glamorous women, and a 1960s television appearance on \"The Hollywood Palace\" hosted by Milton Berle. But one video in particular a performance of Chopin's popular Polonaise in A flat (Op. 53), from what appears to be a 1950s television show was revealing, even touching.Born in 1919 to a humble family in West Allis, Wis., near Milwaukee, Liberace had precocious talent and solid training. His Italian immigrant father, who played the French horn in bands but also held down jobs as a laborer, recognized his son's gifts. Liberace took lessons with Florence Kelly, a student of the virtuoso Moriz Rosenthal.But while Liberace studied classical piano, he also played popular music and jazz in theaters and cabarets. At 20 he played Liszt's Second Piano Concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for a concert in Milwaukee . The reviews were positive, especially from the critic in The Milwaukee Sentinel, who wrote that Liberace \"kept Liszt's bombastic passages within reason\" and \"did not miss some of the piano's most liquid conversations with the woodwinds.\"That same year, 1940, Liberace went to New York and started playing in nightclubs. Thus began his evolution into the flamboyant entertainer who specialized in medleys in which popular songs segued into \"Home on the Range\" and bits of Chopin morphed into \"Chopsticks.\"Still, that broadcast performance of the Chopin polonaise from the 1950s surprised me. From the way Liberace announces the piece, it clearly will be something unusual. Wearing a black tuxedo and facing the camera directly, Liberace explains that he is going to play the Chopin work \"in its entirety.\" The implication is that we are about to be engaged in an act of uncompromising artistry.Actually, Liberace cuts two extended passages, places where sections of the music are essentially repeated. Still, the performance has its charms.Though there are some rough patches, there is fluidity in his technique and nice colorings in his sound. His fingerwork does not seem much encumbered by the ring he wears on his right hand pinkie. This is Chopin's \"Heroic\" Polonaise, and Liberace brings stirring energy to the theme and a nice bounce to the left hand accompaniment, though he stretches the tempo indulgently. The middle section, which breaks into stern marchlike music with a relentlessly repeating bass pattern of four descending notes (played in octaves, is famously difficult. Liberace pulls it off pretty well.Yet something in his playing is frivolous and saccharine. This is not Chopin's exciting polonaise happening in the moment with everything on the line. Rather, this is an exercise in nostalgia. Liberace is reminding us how much we all love this grand and splendid polonaise. Isn't it marvelous?A telltale moment comes in the work's surprising lyrical interlude before the return of the heroic main theme a ruminative passage in which a searching melodic line and gentle chords go through minor mode excursions. Here is music that, for a moment, questions the whole idea of heroism. But Liberace seems oddly inhibited, too reticent to explore the emotional depths and ambiguities.I may be reading too much into the performance. Perhaps I am straining to find early hints of the Liberace who in, three years before his death at, would arrive onstage for a concert at Radio City Music Hall in a silver Rolls Royce and emerge wearing a,000 fox cape with a 16 foot bejeweled train. But to me, the Liberace playing that Chopin polonaise in the 1950s seems to understand that his performance is nothing exceptional, that any number of Juilliard students could have played it better.Of course, some of those Juilliard students, for all their well honed technique, might have lacked a little flair. Liberace certainly had flair.Early in \"Behind the Candelabra\" Mr. Douglas's Liberace, in a self deprecating moment, tells young Thorson that a critic recently complained, \"Liberace is no Rubinstein.\" Well, Liberace retorts, \"Rubinstein is no Liberace!\"Actually, the comparison is interesting. Rubinstein was a master pianist and extraordinary musician, but he had a healthy streak of the entertainer in him. I recently rewatched the French made movie \"Arthur Rubinstein The Love of Life,\" which won the 1969 Academy Award for documentary feature. This wonderful film follows Rubinstein, about 80 at the time, on a visit to Europe and on a stop in Israel, and it includes footage of his early career.In one scene Rubinstein is sitting in the garden of a house he owns in Spain, talking about how audiences loved him from the start. He humorously recalls the sensation he used to create playing Manuel de Falla's brilliant \"Ritual Fire Dance,\" which has a breathless passage in which the two hands play hard driving, alternating chords. Rubinstein explains that, to enhance the drama, he always threw his hands high in the air after striking each chord. The audience would go wild, he said. Leaning back in a chair, Rubinstein says (translated from his fluent French, \"That piece of music bought me this house.\"Toward the end of the documentary, that wizened master is shown speaking with and playing for a group of students in Israel . One piece he plays is the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, and during this impromptu performance he may drop a few more notes than Liberace does in his video.But here is Chopin's familiar polonaise played with exhilarating depth, breadth and majesty. In that pensive interlude, Rubinstein's playing is at once noble and heart wrenching.Yes, this is an unfair comparison. But Liberace, at least the Liberace of \"Behind the Candelabra,\" brought it up."}

I share his enthusiasm for \"Il Prigioniero,\" which I first saw in a wrenching production at the Paris National Opera in.Though this will be a concert performance, the drama comes from Dallapiccola's powerful score.

{"_id": 11, "text": "Encountering Steve Martin at a party can be an uncertain proposition. Maybe you'll end up talking to him about developments in art, politics or the weather . Or maybe he'll ask if you want to add lyrics to some banjo tunes he's been playing around with, an invitation that leads to your making a record together and solidifies a creative union between the two of you.That may sound like the more unlikely outcome, but it is in fact how Edie Brickell, the singer songwriter, ended up working with Mr. Martin, the cultural multihyphenate and sometime bluegrass musician, on \"Love Has Come for You,\" a new album that Rounder Records is to release on Tuesday.Like its origin story, the whole project can seem a little improbable two performers with seemingly not much in common, collaborating on music that doesn't quite sound like anything either has made before.It is mystifying to its creators, too, but also satisfying in a way that they hope listeners will appreciate. As Mr. Martin described his partnership with Ms. Brickell a few weeks ago, \"The whole thing was a giant accident that, in our view, turned out to be very rewarding to us.\"On a March morning, they were sitting a few seats apart in the otherwise empty house of Town Hall in Manhattan. Mr. Martin, 67, who has lately applied his well honed banjo skills to two bluegrass albums, \"The Crow\" and \"Rare Bird Alert,\" the latter recorded with the Steep Canyon Rangers, was playfully professorial, wearing glasses and striped socks that poked out from his pants.Ms. Brickell, 47, best known for her work with the alternative rock band New Bohemians, was dressed in a scarf and tall boots, and spoke in a gentle, ethereal voice. Though the two had been working together for several months, there was a sense that they were still getting to know each other, and Ms. Brickell said she was sometimes intimidated by Mr. Martin's range of abilities, from comedy to essays to playwriting.\"I was shy around him,\" she said. \"When I first started singing in front of him, I didn't want to sing anything that he didn't like. And I didn't know what he liked.\"Their arrangement arose from casual conversations in which Ms. Brickell had complimented Mr. Martin on his bluegrass records, and he offered her a melody he'd composed but for which he had been unable to write lyrics.Listening to Mr. Martin's slow string plucking, Ms. Brickell began to improvise the opening lines \"Lonely, broken feeling Lonely, to my soul\" that became the duo's first song, \"Sun's Gonna Shine.\"In the beginning, Ms. Brickell said she was afraid to tell Mr. Martin exactly what she was singing. \"I was looking at a tadpole of a song,\" she explained, \"and needed to let it grow into a hoppy little number before I shared its essence.\"But Mr. Martin was satisfied with this initial effort, and he gave Ms. Brickell another tune, faster and rhythmic, which she played at home while she was cooking and for which, she said, the lyrics \"flowed out instantly When you get to AshevilleTell me how you're doin'When Mr. Martin heard her lyrics, for \"When You Get to Asheville,\" which became the leadoff track of \"Love Has Come for You,\" he said, \"I thought 'Oh! Good.' We're not writing old fashioned pretend songs. We're writing contemporary songs with sort of an old flavor. The banjo is evocative of something in the past, and these lyrics are evocative of something new.\"As he and Ms. Brickell were fine tuning their demo tracks and passing them back and forth electronically, Mr. Martin played them for a friend, the musician Peter Asher, at another party .Mr. Asher, who was one half of the British pop duo Peter and Gordon and has worked as a manager, producer and record label executive with artists like James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt, suggested to Mr. Martin that these songs could make for an unorthodox album.\"You didn't have to restrict yourself to the bluegrass palette, which is a relatively formal one,\" Mr. Asher recalled in a telephone interview . \"It's like if you're writing Baroque chamber music, you only have a certain number of instruments to choose between. You don't think, what about a few electronic parts? What about a Fender Rhodes keyboard sound? Or what, indeed, about a drummer?\"One e mail exchange later with Mr. Martin, Mr. Asher found himself the producer of \"Love Has Come for You.\"On close inspection, the album reveals ways in which Mr. Martin and Ms. Brickell are not entirely dissimilar. In addition to their overlapping social circle (Ms. Brickell is married to Paul Simon, a longtime friend of Mr. Martin's, they both were born in Texas . While Mr. Martin moved away from Waco at a young age, Ms. Brickell was strongly influenced by her upbringing in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas ."}

{"_id": 12, "text": "A film festival that includes a pair of Weimar influenced pre code Hollywood musicals, three classic cartoons by John and Faith Hubley and a 1936 docudrama in which an American re enacts her imprisonment in Nazi Germany might fairly be called eclectic. Or it might be called To Save and Project, as the Museum of Modern Art titles its annual survey of recently restored movies, which returned this week for its 11th edition. Organized by Joshua Siegel, an associate curator in the museum's film department, the festival has a sweeping nature that suggests how much work is being done to reclaim film history and how much more needs to be done. This year's program contains some 75 feature films and shorts from archives around the world.Two of the most fascinating films in this year's program, for example, had slipped into all but complete obscurity before an intrepid scholar tracked them down. To be screened Oct. 26 and Oct. 28, \"Hitler's Reign of Terror \" (1934) and \"I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany \" (1936) represent seemingly the only English language American films to take a stand against the growing menace of German fascism before Warner Brothers broke the major studios' unseemly silence on the subject in 1939 with \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy .\"Both films were unearthed by Thomas Doherty, a professor of American studies at Brandeis University, as he was researching his recently published study \" Hollywood and Hitler 1933 1939.\" Mr. Doherty, who will introduce the first screening, learned of the titles \"the old fashioned way,\" as he wrote in a recent e mail, \"by scrolling bleary eyed through the microfilm of trade papers like Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and Motion Picture Herald.Produced by and prominently featuring Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., a descendant of the railway magnate who had recast himself as an independent journalist, \"Hitler's Reign of Terror \" is a curious 65 minute assemblage of newsreel material, original footage of Nazi violence that had to be smuggled past German border guards, and what would today be called re enactments of dramatic incidents, including an ambush interview with Hitler. \"And what about the Jews, Your Excellency?\" Vanderbilt demands, recreating the most audacious moment of his encounter.Taking the notion of re enactment to a whole new level, \"I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany \" starred Isobel Lillian Steele, a young American who had gone to Berlin to study music in. Swept up in the arrests surrounding the Nazi exposure of a Polish agent, Steele spent four months in prison. On her return, she helped produce a movie based on her experiences and played herself. Though rhetorically crude and stylistically nonexistent, the film represents a unique dramatization of a disturbing reality that the major studios preferred to ignore, in the interests of maintaining their lucrative market in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.It's a subject addressed by both Mr. Doherty's book and \"The Collaboration Hollywood's Pact With Hitler,\" a recently published study by Ben Urwand that has generated some dispute over its research and claims. Mr. Urwand, for example, relegates \"I Was a Captive\" to an end note, seemingly because it does not fit into his narrative of a film industry doing the will of Nazi masters, while Mr. Doherty explains how this scrappy little film made its way through the system, eventually receiving a seal of approval from Hollywood's own censorship board, the Production Code Administration .Mr. Doherty said he found a print of \"I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany \" fairly easily at the Library of Congress, but \"Hitler's Reign of Terror \" seemed lost until a Belgian film scholar, Roel Vande Winkel, told him it had been discovered at the Cin math que Royale de Belgique.Just how Vanderbilt's marginally distributed movie ended up in Belgium remains something of a mystery. Nicola Mazzanti, director of the Belgian archive, now rebranded the Cinematek, said that the film was found at the customs office in the '60s and deposited at the film center. \"We assume that somebody tried to import it for distribution in late, then the Nazis invaded Belgium, and it was too late,\" Mr. Mazzanti wrote in an e mail.Among the dizzying array of events, MoMA has managed to slip in some of its own restorations. Karl Brown's \"Stark Love,\"(1927) a naturalistic silent melodrama set in the Great Smoky Mountains, will be screened on Thursday at 7 p.m., with the musicologist Gillian B. Anderson conducting a live performance of the recreated original score.MoMA's restored Hubley animations \"Of Stars and Men, \"Urbanissimo\" (1967) and \"Eggs\" (1970) will be introduced on Oct. 22 by the animator Emily Hubley, a daughter of the filmmakers, and the animation historian John Canemaker.Also from MoMA, \"I Am Suzanne!,\" on Friday and Saturday, is a 1933 Fox musical starring Lilian Harvey, the London born singer and dancer who had become Weimar Germany's leading musical star. A parallel presentation, on Nov. 8 and, is \"Caravan, directed by Erik Charell. With its complex camera movements, extreme long takes, Busby Berkeley like musical spectacle and bittersweet, politically charged story of a Gypsy (Charles Boyer) foolish enough to believe that his love for a princess (Loretta Young) will surmount all social barriers, \"Caravan\" is a genuinely great movie awaiting its return to the spotlight. It most likely isn't the only one on the program."}

C. Chandor's melancholy mariner's tale, \"All Is Lost.\" He thought about enduring.\"I'm interested in that thing that happens where there's a breaking point for some people and not for others,\" he said over morning coffee recently in the deserted Owl Bar at his resort here. \"You go through such hardship, things that are almost impossibly difficult, and there's no sign that it's going to get any better, and that's the point when people quit. But some don't.\"That's also what drew him to an earlier story his 1972 tale about a 19th century mountain man battling the wild, \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" shot on Mount Timpanogos where we were sitting.\"You just continue,\" Mr. Redford said. \"Because that's all there is to do.\"Like Mr. Chandor's talky 2011 Wall Street drama, \"Margin Call,\" set on the day a Lehman type firm struggles not to go under, the taciturn \"All Is Lost,\" due in theaters Oct. 18, is an existential horror story about trying to survive the worst moment of your life in this case a crippled boat at sea as panic rises.Mr. Redford has made a career of playing what he calls \"intrinsically American guys\" going up against implacable forces He battled the banks and Pinkertons in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" Indians and grizzlies in \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" a superficial political system in \"The Candidate,\" the Irish mob in \"The Sting,\" the C.I.A. in \"Three Days of the Condor\" and \" Spy Game,\" Richard M. Nixon in \"All the President's Men,\" big business in \"The Electric Horseman,\" and, his most formidable adversary, Barbra Streisand, in \"The Way We Were.\" Hollywood is no country for old men. Yet at, the subject of considerable Oscar talk (David Thomson in The New Republic described his performance in \"All Is Lost\" as \"noble, vulnerable and harrowed, Mr. Redford is soaring as the solo star of a movie that evokes the elegiac spirit of \"Sailing to Byzantium,\" by Yeats, one of his favorite poets. Yeats wrote about sailing \"the mackerel crowded seas,\" coming to terms with the agony of aging and contemplating how the soul can rise above a heart \"fastened to a dying animal.\"Mr. Redford likes to write poetic observations himself. Leaning back in his chair, slender and fit in jeans and Tony Lama cowboy boots, he recited one he had written \"You look up and you realize, what a beautiful day, the leaves are turning and you're starting to feel confident . You're feeling full of yourself until you realize you're drooling.\"He laughed, that great Redford laugh. The thing that's easy to forget about Mr. Redford, with his serious pursuits and perfectionist strivings, is that he can be really fun. We talked for three hours next to the 1890s rosewood bar from Ireland commissioned by the real Hole in the Wall gang. Sitting beneath a sepia picture of him and his pal Paul Newman glowing as Sundance and Butch Cassidy, he tells a story about fame.\"It's right around the time where I'm beginning to think I'm a pretty big deal,\" he said. At a curb in Beverly Hills, \"there's a car coming with a bunch of teenage kids in it. I see they're freaking out inside and trying to get their windows rolled down. I step back. I'm ready for it. 'Robert Redford!' they scream. 'You are such an\" here he drops in a vulgarity for jerk. He grinned. \"That's probably what I would have done at that age.\"Mr. Redford grew up in Los Angeles, a wild child breaking away from a remote, hard to please father, the real Rebel Without a Cause caught up in drinking and drag races. (He even went to the same high school as Natalie Wood.) Breaking into Bel Air mansions, he and a friend were the Bling Ring before the word bling entered the popular lexicon.Bob Redford was popular with girls early, winning a Charleston contest at, but the other boys grew jealous and \"vicious.\"\"Pretty soon it became a regular thing where guys would pass me when I was with a girl and say 'ARF! ARF! ARF!,' and I could see that the girls were bothered,\" he said. Finally one of his friends explained that ARF was the Anti Redford Federation.\"I was so hurt and shocked,\" he said. \"From that point in my life, I retreated into a more loner place. I was then forever shy of going out and expressing myself, and I would do it in my art.\"After his mother died when he was, he left the University of Colorado and went off to be a starving art student in Italy and France. The girls he met in Paris in 1957 did not find him attractive he was mocked for knowing nothing about the Suez Canal and American politics.\"I got kicked in the teeth by Paris,\" he said.He started to read the newspaper, trying to see beyond American sloganeering and explore \"the gray area that was underneath the red, white and blue .\" Just so, his longtime collaborator, Sydney Pollack, said that the actor's allure came from the darker shades lurking beneath his golden facade."}
{"_id": 12, "text": "LOS ANGELES Kerry Washington starts with the shoes. To portray Olivia Pope, the tough crisis manager at the center of the hit ABC series \"Scandal,\" Ms. Washington is always in gravity defying heels. How else to make that sexed up power stalk down the White House corridors?\"I never completely understand a character until I know what kind of shoes they wear,\" Ms. Washington said. For an interview at Milk Studios here, she was in a pair of intimidating white high heels . But Ms. Washington is often in sneakers or flip flops, a clue for anyone trying to understand her. \"It says I'm not really attracted to walking in the world in any one way,\" she explained. \"I like to walk in the world a lot of different ways.\"Those ways have ranged from the role of the slave Broomhilda in Quentin Tarantino's recent \" Django Unchained \" to the pampered Grace Peeples in the modern romantic comedy \"Peeples,\" out on May. But it has been through the intimacy and reach of television that Ms. Washington, 36, has arrived in the center of a major cultural discussion. Thanks to \"Scandal,\" she is only the second black woman in almost 40 years to lead a network television drama, and the first one to make it a bona fide hit. Ratings for the political thriller, which began last April, have been building all season it now beats its rival at 10 p.m. on Thursday \"Elementary\" on CBS many weeks among viewers 18 to, the demographic advertisers covet most.Critics hail its often outrageous, fast paced plot twists. The designer dressed Pope, who has her own crisis management firm, and her team of young \"gladiators in suits\" repair reputations and fix scandals, from kidnappings to murder. Pope is also the former mistress of President Fitzgerald Grant, or Fitz, a white married Republican played by Tony Goldwyn their sex scenes sizzled.\" 'Scandal' has flair and even sophistication,\" the critic Alessandra Stanley wrote in The Times. In no small part that is because of Ms. Washington's ability to convey class and sensuality at the same time, in the words of Reginald Hudlin, a producer of \" Django Unchained .\"For many devotees, the show's depiction of a complex black woman at the top of her game her racial identity never a big deal is the cherry on top. Paradoxically, attention to the breakout role has meant Ms. Washington must carry the racial aspirations and fantasies of more than a few fans as well as the expectation that her success could open doors in the notoriously race averse world of network television.It's clear that \"Scandal\" has touched a nerve Twitter regularly blows up with \"Scandal\" related tweets when the show is on, and the flood of cyberspace chatter has included debates about the interracial sex, the politics and the clothes. Ms. Washington's remark this year that she would have turned down the role had the president been black (out of concern that such a character might reflect an insider's view of Mr. Obama, whose administration she volunteers for) drew attention, too.\"We're putting a lot of our hopes on Kerry's shoulders,\" said Yaba Blay, an assistant professor of Africana Studies at Drexel University, who live tweets about the show with a group of female academics. \"The conversations about her go beyond the role, to the idea of representing us well as middle class and upper middle class, educated women,\" mostly because of the scarcity of such images of black women.\"We are the same women the media has said are not attractive, are not marriageable,\" she added.If that sounds like pressure, Ms. Washington, who comes across as thoughtful, brainy and down to earth in an interview, said she had never felt undue responsibility for presenting a certain brand of black womanhood. In her view, she said, it's more a matter of Hollywood executives catching up with a changing world.A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of George Washington University, where she designed an interdisciplinary major that covered theater, anthropology and sociology, Ms. Washington clearly knows the stakes \"I wanted 'Scandal' to be a success because I wanted networks and studios to believe that people of color and that women can be the driving force both separately and when you happen to have both. I feel proud that we live in a world where 'Scandal' can succeed. It wasn't up to me. The variable was the audience Was the audience going to be ready?\"With Ms. Washington in \"Scandal\" and a black man in the real Oval Office, it seems a long time ago that Teresa Graves was the first black woman to star in a network drama . She played an undercover cop in \"Get Christie Love!\" on ABC in, which was canceled after one season. It drew attention as a barrier breaker but never achieved high ratings. Ms. Graves eventually abandoned acting and died in.Diahann Carroll, who worked with Ms. Washington in \"Peeples,\" appearing briefly as Grace's grandmother, recalled the pains and joys of being a pathbreaker she played the title role in the 1968 71 comedy series \"Julia,\" about a widowed nurse raising her son. But she suggested that Ms. Washington had no real burden to bear. \"This is work,\" Ms. Carroll said. \"It's not fair to ask us to do anything else.\""}
{"_id": 12, "text": "LATE in his career, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"The Blues Had a Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll .\" That, in a nutshell, is the story told in the new documentary \"Born in Chicago \" how he, Howlin' Wolf and other black blues musicians working in Chicago in the 1960s schooled young white acolytes from that city who went on to play on some of the most influential pop recordings of the era.As the film, which will have its New York premiere at 9 p.m. on Friday at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center at Lincoln Center, makes clear, those lessons were transmitted not in a conservatory classroom but in bars, clubs, kitchens and even alleys. In a city divided along racial and ethnic lines, at a time when the civil rights revolution was just beginning, that made both the teachers and their pupils an exception to the unwritten rules.\"We crossed those lines out of a love for the music, and met nothing but kindness, patience and generosity,\" said the keyboard player Barry Goldberg, who helped produce the film and will also be part of a panel discussion after the screening. \"We wanted to learn from these great masters, and they were willing to teach us.\"The guitarist Elvin Bishop tells of being invited to the apartments of the players he admired, like Otis Rush, Sammy Lawhorn, Pee Wee Madison and Little Smokey Smothers, to learn new licks. There would be ham hocks and black eyed peas cooking on the stove, he laughingly recalls in the film, but he would be told he couldn't have any until he got the riff right.\"Born in Chicago,\" which takes its title from a song that Nick Gravenites wrote for his pal Paul Butterfield, who along with him provided one of the inspirations for the Blues Brothers characters, was originally conceived of as a concert DVD featuring the Chicago Blues Reunion band. In addition to Mr. Gravenites, a member of the Blues Hall of Fame who worked with Janis Joplin and the Quicksilver Messenger Service, that group includes Mr. Goldberg, the harmonica and keyboard player Corky Siegel and the guitarist Harvey Mandel, who played with Canned Heat, John Mayall and the Rolling Stones .\"The project just grew and grew, and suddenly we realized we had not just a narrow story, but one that was much broader and deeper,\" said the film's director, John Anderson. \"We were so lucky to capture these anecdotes while these guys are still alive and here to tell the story. Everyone I talked to couldn't believe the story hadn't been told before, and they wanted to make sure the story got out there right.\"That may be especially true for the record producer and executive Marshall Chess, who narrates the film with a Chicago accent as thick as any in an old \" Saturday Night Live \" sketch. His family's record company and studio was home base for Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Chuck Berry, and he was unhappy about how the Chicago blues scene had been portrayed in films like \"Cadillac Records\" and \"Who Do You Love?\"\"It's important to know the real story,\" Mr. Chess said. \"I didn't like the Hollywood fictional treatment. In fact, I was embarrassed by it. This was an amazing part of American history and a big part of Chicago's creative history, though we didn't know it at the time because we were too busy trying to make hit records. I like to say that we had Beethoven, Mozart and Bach on the same label.\"The figure whose energy and charisma dominate much of the film, both through his playing and archival footage of interviews, is Mr. Chess's high school buddy Mike Bloomfield, a guitarist who died at 37 in 1981 after years of drug problems. \"Mike Bloomfield was like a son,\" B. B. King says in the film, but Mr. Bloomfield's contemporaries paint a picture of someone who was not only enormously talented, but also brash enough to make sure everyone else knew it too.\"He said he'd heard my first record and wanted to show me how the blues was played,\" Bob Dylan says in the film, recalling their first meeting in a Chicago club and chuckling at such audacity. Mr. Dylan adds that when he went electric and needed a lead guitarist to play on the groundbreaking \"Highway 61 Revisited\" album and at the Newport Folk Festival, \"I couldn't think of anybody but him. I mean, he was just the best guitar player I ever heard, on any level.\"Much of the film is pervaded by a similar \"sense of loss for a time and a place,\" as Mr. Siegel put it. With the exception of the guitarist Buddy Guy and the drummer Sam Lay, who appears in a poignant scene at Muddy Waters's house, where Mr. Lay and other members of the Waters group rehearsed, the musicians who originated the electrified Chicago blues style are gone. An interview in the film with the guitarist Hubert Sumlin, a breathing tube in his nose, is the last he gave before he died in."}
{"_id": 12, "text": "John Ridley, the screenwriter of \"12 Years a Slave,\" wrote the script on spec. In, Mr. Ridley, who had had a decent career ranging from novelist and sitcom writer (\"Martin,\" \"The Wanda Sykes Show\") to feature gun for hire, sat down with Steve McQueen, the British artist then making a transition to filmmaking. Mr. McQueen introduced him to the 1853 book by Solomon Northup, the memoir of his abduction into slavery. Its voice and detail took Mr. Ridley by surprise.\"I've had a very good education my whole life,\" Mr. Ridley said, \"and as a black American, you think you understand slavery.\" But it quickly became clear \"just how much of the institution I was not aware of, and on top of that, the time and place and geography.\" Mr. McQueen has said he felt the same way.They studied the book, as Mr. Ridley embarked on his own research. Nearly four years later, he delivered his draft 157 pages, far longer than the standard 100 or, full of facts about the Virginia reel and harvesting cane. To get the script made, \"I had to wow people,\" he said. \"I had a nice career, and I had been involved in some very good projects, but this was going to be different.\"When the film went into production in the summer of, Mr. Ridley finally collected a paycheck the kudos, and more important the appreciative audiences, are still coming.\"12 Years a Slave \" is one of the contenders for the best adapted screenplay Oscar, a category that this year encompasses not just the sweep of history and recent events but also moral, romantic and familial courage. Even the smaller stories wrestle with big questions, about faith and the value of breaking free from a circumscribed life themes that often resonate with the Academy. This season's hopefuls may also be marked by gutsiness on the part of the filmmakers, who show ripping dysfunction, graphic flesh and lifelong sorrow on screen.\"12 Years a Slave \" has stirred audiences and critics with its elegant language and depiction of the brutal antebellum South, scenes Mr. Ridley said were often lifted from the book. Others, like \" The Wolf of Wall Street,\" from the memoir by the convicted financier Jordan Belfort \" Captain Phillips,\" the story of a ship attacked by Somali pirates and \"Philomena,\" about an Irishwoman forced to give up her firstborn, embellished on the true lives of their heroes. Then there are screenplays in which writers adapted characters of their own invention Tracy Letts's \"August Osage County,\" based on his Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway play, and \"Before Midnight,\" the third film in the continuing romance of Jesse and Celine, written by the stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy with the director Richard Linklater.According to the rules of the Academy, which will mint some of these screenwriters as Oscar nominees next month, sequels count as adaptations, since they are based on previously published material. Ms. Delpy, Mr. Hawke and Mr. Linklater had created characters that became, over the course of nearly 20 years and two previous films, beloved archetypes of maturing, bohemian life. The idea to revisit them arose over a night of pizza and talking at Mr. Hawke's apartment in New York. \"Just one night of taking it serious what it could be, what it shouldn't be,\" Mr. Linklater said in a recent joint interview with his stars.Because the film's tone is so conversational, and the acting style so naturalistic, many people assume that much of the dialogue is improvised. In fact, it is tightly scripted . \"You can't cut things out of this screenplay,\" Ms. Delpy said.And unlike other movies, Mr. Linklater said, there are no saves in the editing room. \"I liked that feeling, though,\" he said. \"It's like, no, it's got to work today. I like that game time.\"Though they knew this couple intimately, the filmmakers puzzled over the movie's ending or the continuation of their story. \"We killed ourselves trying to figure out what the right note was,\" Mr. Hawke said. \"It was like How bittersweet? Are they going to make it? Are they not going to make it?\"The denouement may be ambiguous, but the affection and discord rang true.\"You know what I love about men?\" Celine says, in a climactic fight scene. \"They still believe in magic. Little fairies around who pick up their socks, little fairies unload the dishwasher, little fairies sunscreen the kids.\"Ms. Delpy, who wrote those lines, said, \"I have 10 women a week coming up to me, about the little fairies 'You helped me a lot with my arguments.' \"The domestic drama in \" The Wolf of Wall Street,\" with its inflated hedonistic lifestyle hookers and drugs and yachts is perhaps less relatable. But Terence Winter, the \"Sopranos\" and \"Boardwalk Empire\" writer who adapted the book for Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio (who plays Mr. Belfort, said that the scenario was neither a cautionary tale nor an aspirational one."}
{"_id": 12, "text": "Fans of the band Thirty Seconds to Mars, accustomed to the long hair, scruffy cheeks, dark sunglasses and rocker's rasp of its frontman, Jared Leto, may find him unrecognizable as Rayon, an AIDS patient and transsexual with a drug problem in the film \" Dallas Buyers Club .\" The waxed eyebrows and concave belly are just the beginning.\" Dallas Buyers Club,\" due out Friday and based on a true story, stars Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof, a tough Texan who in 1985 received a diagnosis of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Woodroof, an electrician and sometime rodeo cowboy, was a homophobe who initially refused to believe he had the disease. His doctors gave him 30 days to live.But Woodroof tried a variety of experimental treatments from outside the United States, smuggling in drugs for himself at first and then helping others. To get around laws against selling unapproved drugs, he started a club, giving free medication in exchange for a membership fee. His 30 days stretched to seven years.Played by an emaciated Mr. McConaughey, who lost nearly 50 pounds for the role, Woodroof finds an unlikely and fictional business partner in the sensitive Rayon, whom he meets at a hospital. Mr. Leto lost a lot of weight for his role, too, about 30 pounds, clocking in at only 116 when he appeared on the set.\"It's a great tool,\" Mr. Leto said of the weight loss . \"It changes the way you walk and talk and think and feel, the way people treat you, the choices you make.\"Losing weight or gaining, as Mr. Leto did to play Mark David Chapman in \"Chapter 27\" (2007) is an indication of an actor's determination. (It's also a feat that Oscar tends to appreciate. See Charlize Theron, \"Monster,\" or Adrien Brody, \"The Pianist.\") But the creation of Rayon was a collaborative effort that involved far more effort than that to weave its illusion, starting with the script.\"In a short period of time, you can demonstrate everything about Ron Woodroof, when you put him in the room with Rayon,\" said Melisa Wallack, who wrote the film with Craig Borten. They created the character, they said in a joint interview, to help convey Woodroof's gradual acceptance of a subculture he had dismissed.When it was time to cast Rayon, Mr. Leto was in Europe touring with Thirty Seconds to Mars he hadn't done a film in several years because of the band's success. He met the film's director, Jean Marc Vall e, via Skype, using the call as an opportunity to explore the character.\"He had a wig on, a dress, and he was putting on some lipstick,\" Mr. Vall e said. \"I thought he was going to get out of it and continue the conversation being Jared, and he didn't.\" Some 20 minutes later, the call ended with Mr. Leto still in character. Mr. Vall e called the producers and said, \"I met Rayon tonight.\"Part of Mr. Leto's preparation involved research. \"The beginning for me was listening to transgender people sharing stories, learning what it was like to transition, learning what it was like to tell your father who you really were, or really are,\" he said. The costume design team Kurt Swanson and Bart Mueller, who have worked together for more than 20 years, showed Mr. Leto pictures of transsexuals they knew from their clubbing days in Manhattan, Mr. Swanson said. They used a well known photo of the Warhol actress Jane Forth, with no eyebrows and a scarf around her head, as inspiration.\"That whole Jane Forth look, it's all about face,\" Mr. Mueller said. \"If you don't have hair, it's just about face. And Jared, once the eyebrows came off, and you tied a scarf around the face, and it's just face, that's when Jared transformed.\"Ms. Forth was an influence in the makeup design as well, as were Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot and stars of the '80s like Pat Benatar, the movie's lead makeup artist, Robin Mathews, said in an e mail.Among the challenges were having both Rayon and Woodroof appear in different stages of their illnesses, sometimes in as many as five in one day's shooting. \"I had to make them look as if they were healthy and had gained about 20 pounds,\" Ms. Mathews said, \"and then back to emaciated and sick.\"\"Rayon's health declines more rapidly because she is a drug user,\" Ms. Mathews wrote. \"This also causes her to manifest different physical maladies, such as blemishes and sores from picking her skin, which she tries to hide with makeup.\"Several people involved in \" Dallas Buyers Club \" said that, in a sense, they never really met Mr. Leto until months after the shoot was over, at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the film had its premiere. He remained in character throughout the 25 day shoot.\"That phrase 'staying in character' to me really means commitment, focus, and for a role like this that's so intense and challenging and extreme in a lot of ways, it demanded my full attention,\" Mr. Leto said. \"I couldn't imagine every time the director yelled 'Action!' that I would recall all of the aspects, the physical and emotional characteristics of the character, at a moment's notice.\"Judging from the early reviews, that commitment paid off. Writing for Time.com after \" Dallas Buyers Club \" showed in Toronto, Richard Corliss wrote, \"Leto captures the sweet intensity and almost saintly good humor of a glamorous, poignant and downright divoon creature a blithe Camille who may surrender her health but never her panache.\" Mr. Leto has moved on, though. He'll soon be performing with Thirty Seconds to Mars in Europe, and has not made time to see \" Dallas Buyers Club .\"\"The film isn't really for me right now, it's for everyone else,\" he said. \"I was there. I read the script. I was in the scenes and I had the pleasure of being on set and inhabiting this role, and that was incredible.\""}
{"_id": 12, "text": "Did you watch the classic 1980 horror film \"The Shining\" and think it was about a man driven to insane and murderous rage by a haunted hotel ? If so, you blew it. Or rather, you missed profound messages subtly embedded in the film by its enigmatic director, Stanley Kubrick.That, at least, is the notion behind \"Room,\" a documentary by Rodney Ascher released on Friday. The movie is a series of voice overs atop scenes from Kubrick movies by a small assortment of obsessives who have developed baroque theories about the true meaning of \"The Shining.\" One believes the film is about the slaughter of American Indians, another that it is about the Holocaust. Yet another claims it is a kind of apology by Kubrick for the putative role he played in helping to fake the moon landing. And there's more.The documentary could be construed as a sly tribute to \"The Shining\" as measured by the startling variety of fanciful postulations and close viewings it has inspired. But the theories are presented with such a surprising lack of irony that it seems as though \"Room 237\" the name refers to the scariest suite in the Kubrick movie's snowbound Overlook Hotel just might want its audience to take them seriously.That makes the theories fair game for a sober assessment. And who better to provide one than Leon Vitali, who is listed in the closing credits of \"The Shining\" as personal assistant to the director? Mr. Vitali had an acting role in Kubrick's 1975 movie \"Barry Lyndon,\" went to work for him soon after and remained on his payroll for decades. Mr. Vitali's first task as an assistant was to fly to the United States to cast the role of Danny, the child of Jack ( Jack Nicholson ) and Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall. He was present during the 13 month filming at sound stages near London, and throughout postproduction.Mr. Vitali, 64, is a Briton who now lives in Los Angeles, where he works on his own and other film projects. He was recently sent an advance copy of \"Room,\" and not surprisingly it elicited a strong response.\"I was falling about laughing most of the time,\" he said by telephone. \"There are ideas espoused in the movie that I know to be total balderdash.\"Take, for instance, the scene near the end of \"The Shining\" in which Jack Torrance is about to chop down a door as he chases his wife and child with an ax. The character recites a few lines of the \"Three Little Pigs\" story. \"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in,\" Jack huffs, mugging and grinning in pure derangement. \"Not by the hair on your chinny chin chin.\"In \"Room,\" Geoffrey Cocks, a professor of history at Albion College in Michigan and author of \"The Wolf at the Door Stanley Kubrick, History, and the Holocaust,\" writes that Disney's original animated version of \"Three Little Pigs\" featured an anti Semitic caricature, a wolf dressed as a Jewish peddler. He ties that in with several supposed references to the Holocaust to suggest that Kubrick wanted to link the fictional horror in \"The Shining\" with the real world horror of the Nazi concentration camps.That reading implies that Kubrick planned to use \"Three Little Pigs.\" But according to Mr. Vitali, when the scene was being filmed Kubrick brainstormed with him and Mr. Nicholson what Jack Torrance ought to howl before swinging his ax.\"Stanley thought the scene needed something, a few lines for Jack that would make him sound threatening and nasty,\" Mr. Vitali recalled, but lines that could, in another context, sound soothing. \"Three Little Pigs\" was proposed, but nobody was quite sure about the words. So Kubrick called the mother of Danny Lloyd, the child actor who'd won the role of Danny Torrance.\"She was staying in an apartment nearby and she had the words to 'Three Little Pigs' right there,\" Mr. Vitali said.Mr. Vitali also cautioned against the suggestion that there might be Holocaust overtones to the German made Adler typewriter that Jack uses to tap out his mad loop of \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\"\"That was Stanley's typewriter,\" he said. \"A lot of decisions made on the set were about pragmatism 'This looks good. It sits on the oak table pretty perfectly.' Not to mention, it's a great typewriter. I used that typewriter for 10 years, actually.\"Kubrick, who died in, was legendary for his perfectionism, but he also believed in improvisation. What looks to many of the Shinologists in \"Room 237\" like the result of careful planning is often mere happenstance.There are scenes, for instance, in which Danny wears a sweater showing the Apollo 11 rocket . This becomes part of the faked moon landing theory, as articulated by Jay Weidner, an author and independent filmmaker.\"That was knitted by a friend of Milena Canonero,\" the costume designer, Mr. Vitali said. \"Stanley wanted something that looked handmade, and Milena arrived on the set one day and said, 'How about this?' It was just the sort of thing that a kid that age would have liked.\"Likewise, the cans of Calumet baking powder seen in the Overlook pantry were chosen not because they featured an American Indian in headdress, thus highlighting Kubrick's interest in the plight of the American Indian, but because they had bright, bold colors.\"Part of what I did during that trip to the U.S. in 1975 was shoot larders in hotels,\" said Mr. Vitali, using the British word for pantries. \"It was so that Stanley\" who was American born but had lived in England for years by then \"knew what one was likely to see there. And I found Calumet cans all over the place.\"Yet another contention is that a poster in the Overlook shows a Minotaur, suggesting that the movie is a retelling of the Greek myth about the part man, part bull.\"That astonished me,\" Mr. Vitali said. \"I stood staring at all that stuff for weeks while we were shooting in that room. It's a downhill skier. It's a downhill skier. It's not a Minotaur.\"Mr. Vitali said he never spoke with Kubrick about any larger meaning in \"The Shining.\" \"He didn't tell an audience what to think or how to think,\" he said, \"and if everyone came out thinking something differently that was fine with him. That said, I'm certain that he wouldn't have wanted to listen to about, or maybe 80 percent\" of \"Room.\""}

(And there's \"The World's End\" later this summer.)The plot points, actors and jokes overlap from film to film, so here is a primer to guide you through the chaos .SETUP Mr. Rogen and Jay Baruchel (as themselves) crash a party at James Franco's bachelor pad, but the drug augmented festivities are abruptly interrupted by apocalyptic happenings outside. Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson center, with, from left, Mr. Franco, Danny McBride, Mr. Baruchel and Mr. Rogen and Mr. McBride are among the initial survivors.METHOD OF DESTRUCTION It's the rapture, as described in the Book of Revelation.

It certainly appears that way, even as some questions remain.Shares of MGM Holdings' thinly traded over the counter stock have risen 50 percent since April, to about.50. Revenue almost tripled in the last quarter, to 339 million, according to the company . Helped by repeated Standard Poor's upgrades over the last three years, MGM now has access to revolving lines of credit totaling 750 million .\"The company was on death's doorstep and now has effectively no debt and is generating a ton of cash,\" said Kevin Ulrich, co founder of Anchorage Capital Group, a New York investment firm that is MGM's largest single owner, with a 30 percent stake . \"That's an outstanding turnaround.\"Most important, new movies are flowing from the studio. A remake of \"Carrie\" arrives on Oct. 18, while the blockbuster \"Hobbit\" series returns in December. \"RoboCop,\" \"22 Jump Street\" and \"Hercules\" come next year. MGM's James Bond franchise returns in 2015 and remakes of \"Ben Hur\" and \"Poltergeist\" are in the works.MGM's television business a vital part of its growth strategy is also showing momentum. \" Vikings \" had its debut on the History channel and was an instant hit. \"Teen Wolf\" continues on MTV, while \"Paternity Court \" arrives in syndication on Sept. 23 and a series adapted from \"Fargo\" chugs toward FX .\"The MGM name had become pretty toxic, both in the financial community and the creative one, and that's certainly not the case anymore,\" Gary Barber, MGM's chief executive, said last week in a wide ranging interview. He added, \"I feel that MGM is fully rehabilitated.\" Hollywood is not entirely convinced. Some movie executives dismiss the studio as little more than a,000 movie library that has already been aggressively exploited on DVD and in cable reruns. The studio's library generated about 558 million in revenue in, when the DVD market was strong. The total had plunged to 228 million by.MGM has in recent years declined to disclose how much revenue its stockpile of old films generates, leading to suspicion that sales are weak. All Mr. Barber will say is that library revenue is \"substantial.\"MGM has blown the comeback trumpets before only to have its owners cash out and leave the studio reeling anew. The billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, for instance, bought and sold the studio three times between 1969 and. By that measure, the studio's long term future is far from clear. In addition to Anchorage, shareholders include hedge funds like Highland Capital Management and Davidson Kempner. Many initially bought MGM debt, which was converted to equity in 2010 as part of a prepackaged bankruptcy. Hedge funds are not known as patient caretakers.\"It's one thing to say the company is doing great, but it's another thing to successfully sell out a position,\" said Steven Azarbad, co founder of Maglan Capital, a small hedge fund that owns about 1 percent of MGM. \"This thing should either be sold or I.P.O.'d. I'd like to see that happen by the end of the year.\"Selling is a potential option. (Lions Gate Entertainment is seen as the likeliest bidder.) MGM could also potentially expand through an acquisition of its own. As for an initial public offering, the studio last year filed a registration statement for one, but never moved forward with it. Because the studio has since grown, that filing is void.\"An I.P.O. will continue to be an opportunity,\" Mr. Barber said. \"We're carefully evaluating all of our options. Quite frankly, we don't need that capital right now.\"Are his hedge fund shareholders restless? \"No, no, no,\" Mr. Barber said. \"The board of directors is strongly supportive of the business strategy we have developed and that's not for tomorrow but for long term value growth . That's a critical difference from the past.\"Mr. Ulrich, of Anchorage, said, \"As long as the return profile remains very strong we will remain a key shareholder.\" Using standard financial comparisons, Anchorage and others believe that MGM is sharply undervalued compared to other independent studios like DreamWorks Animation and Lions Gate."}

The Standard Poor's 500 index fell 14 points, or.9 percent, to,676, the lowest in a month. The Nasdaq composite fell 37 points, or 1 percent, to,770. Global markets were mainly lower and the price of oil dropped as traders became nervous about the standoff in Washington, particularly over the debt ceiling . The United States has to raise its debt ceiling by Oct. 17. If it doesn't, the world's largest economy faces the possibility of defaulting on its debts, a move that would send shock waves around the global economy and financial markets .Though most analysts think a deal between Republicans in Congress and the White House to avoid default will be cobbled together in time, investors are fidgety uncertainty discourages them from buying into risky assets, like stocks .On Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner ruled out a vote on a straightforward bill to raise the government's borrowing authority without concessions from President Obama before the deadline.\"As the partial shutdown of the U.S. government enters week two, there is little sign that the fiscal stalemate in Washington is being broken,\" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. \" Investors are on the sidelines until there is greater clarity or a last minute resolution between the White House and the Republicans ahead of the debt ceiling deadline.\"In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended the session down.3 percent, and Germany's DAX fell.4 percent.

It's the lack of trust.\"At what point does this stop?\" asked Gary Lynch, the former director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission who has gone on to jobs with many leading Wall Street firms and is now global general counsel at Bank of America . He was referring to the escalation in penalties being levied on banks, culminating in the 13 billion JPMorgan Chase was forced to pay for a series of transgressions.Speaking at a banking industry conference last month in New York, Mr. Lynch recalled that he had been working at Morgan Stanley in London before he returned to this country in 2011 to join Bank of America . He had thought, he said, that by then three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off the financial crisis anger at banks would have declined.He was wrong \"It was worse.\" Bankers don't feel very popular in Europe, either. In Germany, J rgen Fitschen, the co chief executive of Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in the country, is furious with Wolfgang Sch uble, the German finance minister, for saying that \" banks still show great creativity in evading regulation .\" That meant, he said, that it was necessary to keep pushing on new bank regulations.\"It's irresponsible to comment in such a populist manner,\" Mr. Fitschen complained. Deutsche Bank's latest brush with regulators sounds positively puny by JPMorgan standards. It was forced by the European Union to pay 725 million euros nearly 1 billion for its role in fixing and manipulating the Libor rate.Mr. Fitschen evidently views those sins as irrelevant now, explaining that it is wrong to think \"things haven't changed since 2008 or.\" Actually, the Libor violations at some banks continued until at least, although we don't know whether that was true at Deutsche as well.It was only 11 years ago that the S.E.C., outraged by accounting fraud at Xerox, levied a 10 million fine. That was a record, recalled Steve Cutler, who was the commission's director of enforcement at the time, speaking on the same panel as Mr. Lynch at the banking conference sponsored by The Clearing House, an organization of large banks .\"We should all be concerned that there doesn't seem to be a natural end point to how high fines could go,\" said Mr. Cutler, who is now the general counsel of JPMorgan and was involved in negotiating the 13 billion settlement . \"One hundred million dollars is still meaningful,\" he added, in what might be labeled wishful thinking .It may not be easy to be sympathetic to the big banks, but it is easy to understand their surprise and frustration. They have gone from being viewed as national champions proof of a country's standing in the world to being seen as a potential source of national disaster. Iceland and Ireland went broke because they had to, or chose to, bail out their irresponsible banks .That no top bankers went to jail may be proper it is not a crime to make stupid mistakes, and much of what happened in the years before the financial crisis was more foolish than venal but it grated to see few of them fired while those who stayed went back to collecting multimillion dollar bonuses .Eric H. Holder Jr ., the attorney general, did not help when he said last spring that the Justice Department had to keep in mind that filing criminal charges against a large bank could \"have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy .\" He quickly backtracked, but the perception was reinforced.It seems likely that the reaction to his first statement played a role in causing the government to demand JPMorgan pay so much money .This week five United States regulators the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the S.E.C. jointly issued new rules on the Volcker Rule passed as part of the Dodd Frank law in.The regulators had some choice in details, because the rule, as passed by Congress, is a contradiction in terms. It bans \" proprietary trading \" by banks, or trading for their own gain, but carves out exceptions for \"hedging\" and \" market making.\" Define them broadly enough, and almost nothing would remain of the rule. Define them narrowly enough and the exceptions could be meaningless."}

The September figures were delayed from their traditional release time of the first Friday of the month because of the shutdown.After the figures were released, global stock markets turned even higher, while the dollar's weakness was sustained as investors decided it was unlikely that the Fed would start reducing its 85 billion worth of monthly asset purchases this year. Until the budget stalemate in Washington, many investors had thought the Fed would already be \"tapering\" the stimulus.\"From the Fed's standpoint, this morning's report reaffirms their position to hold monthly asset purchases steady at 85 billion a month and essentially takes tapering off the table for October and likely December as well,\" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee .In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose .6 percent, to close at,695.66 points, while Germany's DAX rose.9 percent, to,947.46.

{"_id": 13, "text": "A shudder went through Wall Street on Friday after the revelation that Bloomberg News reporters had extracted subscribers' private information through the company's ubiquitous data terminals to break news.The company confirmed that reporters at Bloomberg News, the journalism arm of Bloomberg L.P., had for years used the company's terminals to monitor when subscribers had logged onto the service and to find out what types of functions, like the news wire, corporate bond trades or an equities index, they had looked at. Bloomberg terminals, which cost an average of more than,000 a year, are found in nearly every banking and trading company . Bloomberg said the functions that allowed journalists to monitor subscribers were a mistake and were promptly disabled after Goldman Sachs complained that a Bloomberg reporter had, while inquiring about a partner's employment status, pointed out that the partner had not logged onto his Bloomberg terminal lately.The incident led to broader concerns about the line at Bloomberg between its lucrative terminal business and the hypercompetitive newsroom, threatening to undermine the credibility of both. In a secretive world that thrives on opacity, traders and financial firms jealously guard every speck of information about their activity to avoid tipping their hand on their trades and investments.\"On Wall Street, anonymity is critically important . Secrecy and the ability to cover one's tracks is paramount,\" said Michael J. Driscoll, a former senior trader at Bear Stearns who now teaches at Adelphi University. He added \"If Bloomberg reporters crossed that line, that's an issue.\"The news gathering technique appears more widespread than the Goldman incident, which was first reported by The New York Post. A preliminary analysis at Bloomberg revealed that \"several hundred\" reporters had used the technique, a person briefed on the analysis said. ( Bloomberg employs more than,400 journalists worldwide. A spokesman declined to comment on the analysis and said no reporters had been fired.)There are also fears that the monitoring may have gone beyond Wall Street . Banking regulators at the Federal Reserve are examining whether their own employees were subject to tracking by Bloomberg reporters, according to people briefed on the matter. A spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment .There are now more than,000 Bloomberg terminal subscribers worldwide who rely on the desktop computer for research, trading, communication and a constant stream of financial information and news.But as it turned out, what the subscribers were doing was not always confidential. Bloomberg reporters used the \"Z function\" a command using the letter Z and a company's name to view a list of subscribers at a firm . Then, a Bloomberg user could click on a subscriber's name, which would take the user to a function called UUID. The UUID function then provided background on an individual subscriber, including contact information, when the subscriber had last logged on, chat information between subscribers and customer service representatives, and weekly statistics on how often they used a particular function. A company spokesman said both of those functions had been disabled in the newsroom.Terminals never allowed journalists to see specific securities or trades, but even general hints of what users are searching could provide a glimpse into Wall Street's thinking powerful currency in the competitive world of financial journalism. Daniel L. Doctoroff, chief executive of Bloomberg L.P. and a close confidant to the company's founder, Michael R. Bloomberg, said in a memo to employees that \"client trust is our highest priority and the cornerstone of our business .\" Mr. Bloomberg stepped away from day to day operations when he became mayor of New York City .Last month, the company further centralized its data security efforts, including appointing Steve Ross, a senior executive, to the newly created role of client data compliance officer .\"To be clear, the limited customer relationship data previously available to our reporters never included access to our trading, portfolio, monitor, blotter or other related systems or our clients' messages,\" Mr. Doctoroff said. He posted a damage control message to clients on the Bloomberg terminal and blog, calling the reporting practice a \"mistake.\""}

P. 500 remains up.5 percent for the year so far.While some analysts argue the long term trend is still higher, many see momentum for stocks waning in the near term without more positive catalysts . Trading volume has been lighter than average, and volatility has been low in recent days .\"Intraday volatility has essentially been nonexistent. I think it means people are really sitting on the sidelines right now seeing which way it's going to go,\" said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York. He expects the rally to top out in the next two weeks. The CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, a measure of market expectations and stability, ended down.3 percent.Among the day's declining issues, the fast food chain operator Yum Brands fell 2 percent, to.92. After the market closed on Friday, Yum posted a steep decline in April sales in China . Retail sales rose .1 percent in April, better than the.3 percent drop that had been expected and a return to growth after a decline in March, which helped buoy markets on Monday. Excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, core sales rose .5 percent. Retail sales account for about 30 percent of American consumer spending . Investors are at odds over whether positive economic data can help the market rise further, or whether it will spell the end of the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus, which could derail the rally, said Joseph S. Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds .Other economic data released on Monday showed business inventories were unchanged in March for a second straight month, versus expectations of a.3 percent rise, suggesting that restocking could help second quarter economic growth . Earnings have been mostly better than expected. With 90 percent of the S. P. 500 having reported, 67.2 percent of companies topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data . Only.9 percent have beaten revenue expectations, below the 52 percent average over the last four quarters.Shares of the Israeli Internet company Perion Network listed in the United States surged.6 percent, to.94, after it posted quarterly earnings . Volume was roughly .3 billion shares traded on the New York markets, well below the average daily closing volume of about .4 billion this year.The price of the benchmark 10 year Treasury note fell 5 32 to, pushing the yield up to.92, from.90 on Friday."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "MIDLAND, Mich. As Dow Chemical's chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris has made himself into something of an outcast among his fellow business leaders .The reason? He is spearheading a public campaign against increased exports of natural gas, which he sees as a threat to a manufacturing renaissance in the United States, not to mention his own company's bottom line. But many others say such exports would provide far more benefits to the country than drawbacks, all part of a transformation that promises to increase the nation's weight in the global economy .The debate has grown personal. In the words of Charif Souki, an energy industry executive promoting a new natural gas export facility, Mr. Liveris is both \"self serving\" and a \"hypocrite.\"Now it seems that one constituency where Mr. Liveris had gained a sympathetic ear, the federal government, may also have turned against him. Last week, the Energy Department approved another planned project to export natural gas, the second such proposal it has accepted since May.The battle over natural gas exports reflects just how starkly the nation's economic landscape is being reshaped by newfound energy supplies much of the discoveries in the form of oil and gas being freed up by unconventional methods like horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing .As environmentalists and industry advocates debate the merits and risks of fracking, as the practice is frequently called, its consequences are increasingly visible. Last week, the government reported a sharply improved trade balance for June, largely because of lower oil imports .By, new oil and gas production could increase the country's economic output by 2 to 4 percent beyond what it otherwise would be, add as many as.7 million jobs and perhaps reduce the bill for energy imports to zero, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute.\"This is a giant turnaround,\" said Daniel Yergin, a longtime energy expert and author of a recent book, \"The Quest Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World .\" \"This is fundamentally improving the competitive position of the United States in the world economy .\"But that windfall is at risk if the government permits natural gas exports to increase quickly, Mr. Liveris warns.\"What a hand the United States has been dealt!\" he said in an interview in his office here.To nurture the nation's good luck, he says, the government needs to plan an energy policy that carefully balances the interests of the oil and gas companies that want to freely export natural gas with those of industries like Dow Chemical that fear that an export boom could outpace domestic gas supplies and bring higher energy prices .An Australian by birth and citizenship, Mr. Liveris has emerged as the principal opponent of unfettered natural gas exports . Mr. Liveris has founded a lobbying organization to promote his cause, and he sharply criticized an Energy Department report last December that said liquefied gas could produce 30 billion a year in export earnings without meaningfully driving up domestic gas prices for consumers .\"Why should we gamble?\" he asked. \"I think we should be out of the gambling business on energy policy . I mean, we're not in the gambling business on food policy. We're not in the gambling business on defense.\"After spiking in the last decade, natural gas prices in the United States have hovered between 3 and 4 per million B.T.U.'s this year. That is down from a high of 12 before the recession, and a fraction of what it costs in Asia and Europe .That price differential is one reason exports are so appealing for domestic energy companies, who are willing to spend billions to build export facilities to ship liquefied natural gas in tankers in the hopes of selling it overseas.On the other hand, cheap domestic supplies mean Dow one of the biggest private consumers of natural gas in the country and other chemical companies are now paying much less than their foreign competitors for the raw material they turn into products like plastic, raising profit margins . It could also bring back jobs to the United States as manufacturers that use natural gas for energy benefit, Mr. Liveris says, although that renaissance is just in its infancy.Mr. Liveris withdrew his company from the National Association of Manufacturers this year when his ideas clashed with those of other members, particularly Exxon Mobil, which hopes to convert a Louisiana gas terminal that was built to import the fuel to process exports instead. In an interview, Ken Cohen, an Exxon Mobil vice president, said that having a major business leader like Mr. Liveris supporting \"protectionism\" is so incongruous that \"it's almost like man bites dog.\"Mr. Liveris even came close to withdrawing Dow Chemical from the American Chemistry Council over the export issue, until the trade group modified its pro export position."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "BARTON, England Driving down a bumpy country road in northwest England, one comes upon a bare patch the size of a soccer field at the edge of a peat bog. Workers are erecting a security fence and unrolling watertight film to protect the soil from chemical contamination. Near the middle is a big rectangular hole where a drilling rig will go.Inauspicious as it may look, what happens on this patch of ground in the coming months could help determine the future of Britain's, and even Europe's, approach to shale gas . The energy source has made the United States, for one, suddenly self sufficient in natural gas, but it raises environmental concerns that have made many countries on this side the Atlantic dead set against it. Shale gas is extracted by the technique known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking, the harsh sounding word that can stir the passions of the technology's harshest critics.In France, the nation's highest court recently upheld the government's right to ban fracking. In Germany, fracking activity is suspended at least until a new government is formed.But within the European Union, Britain struggling to confront its energy future as its North Sea oil reserves are depleted, dirty coal is demonized and nuclear power remains expensive and geopolitically fraught stands out as the country in which the government has officially encouraged the development of shale gas . Prime Minister David Cameron has thrown his support behind shale gas drilling, hoping to reap some of the benefits seen in the United States .John Blaymires, chief operating officer of IGas Energy, said the government's support could reap big rewards for Britain, especially in the industrial Manchester Liverpool region, where the soccer field sized bare patch is being readied in Barton. \"There is another Aberdeen waiting to be created,\" he said, referring to Scotland's North Sea oil hub. \" Manchester and Liverpool could be centers of excellence.\"IGas, one of the small British companies chasing big dreams of shale gas riches, has assembled a large package of acreage in an area that geologists say looks particularly promising. The company plans to drill an exploratory well here before the end of the year. If it likes what it finds, the company would then probably apply for permission to hydraulically fracture that well, or others that they may also drill in the area, to find out whether there are strong enough gas flows from the shale rock to make further investment worthwhile.On a recent day, Mr. Blaymires led a tour of the windswept site and another about a half hour's drive to the west, in Warrington, where the company is already producing methane gas from coal beds a conceptually similar technique that is also still considered unconventional.IGas was founded in 2004 mainly to develop coal gas . But the company now reckons that shale gas, which it thinks can be found at greater depths than the coal in the area, may prove more promising. Mr. Blaymires said that 2014 and early 2015 were shaping up as a \"critical period\" for the company and the industry. \"In all likelihood, a number of wells will be drilled and fracked, and that will determine the commercial potential of shale in the U.K.,\" he said.If so, those will be the first tests of hydraulic fracturing in shale since another small company, Cuadrilla Resources, set off seismic and political tremors with fracking in 2011 at a site not far from Barton.This summer, a well that Cuadrilla drilled in Balcombe, in the commuter country south of London, set off protests from environmentalists and local opponents that received enormous attention from the media the fact that it was a conventional oil well, not a fracking well for shale gas, almost seemed beside the political point.British environmental groups remain largely opposed to shale gas fracking, even though it has the potential to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions if used as a substitute for coal in power generation . Even more than seismic concerns, they worry about possible water pollution, noise and other disruptions."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "AUSTIN, Texas On the subject of genetically modified foods, the United States and Europe could hardly be farther apart. U.S. grocery stores are well stocked with genetically modified cereals and other products, while Europeans have found ways to keep them off the shelves.But recently, a few fissures have appeared on both sides of the Atlantic.In pockets of the United States, momentum is building behind the concept of labeling genetically modified foods (crops whose genetic makeup is altered to increase yields and to more effectively resist problems like pests and drought. Such labels are already required in the European Union and Australia.In Europe, concern about genetically modified foods remains entrenched, but the British government has recently signaled a new openness. In a forceful speech last month, Owen Paterson, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, said that the government was prepared to \"roll out the red carpet \" for research and development of new agricultural technologies, including genetically modified crops, so that Britain could contribute to bolstering of global food supplies .\"When it comes to developing and benefiting from G.M. technology, I want the U.K. to be at the forefront of the global race, not watching from the sidelines,\" said Mr. Paterson, whose speech indeed incited a vigorous debate in Britain. (Another member of Parliament told The Independent newspaper that Mr. Paterson had \"swallowed the industry line hook, line and sinker without talking to anyone with a different view.\")Whether these developments will be followed by a narrowing of trans Atlantic policy differences relating to genetically modified products remains to be seen. This week, U.S. and E.U. officials have been meeting in Washington to begin work on a far reaching trade agreement . Genetically modified crops are one of the most complicated issues under discussion, according to William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a U.S. group that advocates for lower trade barriers .\"Because it will be such a deeply felt issue on both sides, it will probably be one of the last things to be resolved,\" Mr. Reinsch said.More substantive discussion of issues involving genetically modified foods will probably be deferred until the next round of trade talks, in the autumn, he said.American farmers, a politically powerful group, want more access to European markets for genetically modified crops . But Europe, where genetic modification is common in animal feeds but not in supermarket foods, is certain to resist. The E.U. has approved only one genetically modified crop for cultivation over the past 14 years, according to Mr. Paterson, the British official.The E.U.'s strict labeling requirements, enacted in, are among the frustrations for American farmers, who say labels discourage consumers from buying a product that is safe and has been in the U.S. food system for decades. Partly for that reason, according to Richard Wilkins, the treasurer of the American Soybean Association, soybean exports from the United States to E.U. member states fell by 82 percent between 1998 and.\"The G.M.O. labeling requirements in the E.U. are egregious,\" Mr. Wilkins said a statement that would elicit sharp disagreements from opponents of genetically modified organisms, who are concerned about matters like allergens, potential cross contamination of other species and overuse of pesticides and weed killing herbicides.Yet even as the labeling debate resurfaces in the trade talks, the practice is starting to take root within the United States .Whole Foods, a national supermarket chain based in Austin, plans to begin requiring labels for foodstuffs containing genetically modified organisms by. Connecticut recently became the first state to approve a provisional labeling law, though it will take effect only if four other states do the same. The Legislature in Maine passed a similar bill (it awaits the governor's signature, and a number of other states, including Massachusetts and Illinois, are also considering labeling requirements.\" Activists have been working on this labeling issue for a long time because they see it as a way to influence industry behavior,\" said Rachel A. Schurman, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota . \"And they haven't had a lot of success in the United States otherwise.\"The labeling initiatives, Ms. Schurman said, have grown out of a rising general interest in food and dietary issues in the United States, thanks to a number of movies on the topic, as well as popular writers like Michael Pollan, who focuses on responsible eating.\"Now food is really on the agenda in the U.S. in the way it wasn't before, so I think there's a lot more momentum around labeling,\" Ms. Schurman said.The labeling initiatives will increase Americans' awareness of genetically modified foods, said Brian Wynne, a professor of sociology at Lancaster University in Britain.\"It is going to be interesting to see where this leads,\" Mr. Wynne wrote in an e mail. \"I think that U.S. attitudes are typically less cleanly positive than they are assumed to be from surveys, and the same goes for E.U. ones, in the other direction.\"Still, others said Europe's longstanding hostility to genetically modified foods would prove tough to overcome.\"Europe is extremely cautious even irrationally cautious,\" said Louise Fresco, a professor at the University of Amsterdam and a former assistant director general for agriculture at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization .It will be interesting to see, she said, whether the new moves by officials in Britain will result in \"breaking through the deadlock, perhaps, in Europe.\""}
{"_id": 14, "text": "OTTAWA A pipeline for exporting oil sands bitumen to Asia bound tankers was dealt a severe blow on Friday when the province of British Columbia urged a federal review panel to reject the 6 billion plan.The proposal to build the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline and its port is effectively Alberta's backup plan in case the Obama administration turns down the Keystone XL, a pipeline that would link the oil sands with American refineries on the Gulf Coast . Several of the concerns raised by British Columbia in its rejection echo those of American environmentalists regarding Keystone XL.In its 99 page submission, the province questioned Enbridge's claims that it could mitigate spills in its remote mountain wilderness and off its rugged coastline.Enbridge, the province wrote, \"presented little evidence about how it will respond in the event of a spill.\" The submission said that from the company's evidence it was not clear that it \"will in fact be able to respond effectively to spills either from the pipeline itself or from tankers\" and added, \" 'Trust me' is not good enough in this case .\"Enbridge, which is based in Calgary, did not comment on the submission.Like Keystone XL, the Northern Gateway project would carry tarlike bitumen from the oil sands, which is diluted with solvents to allow it to flow through pipes. As has been the case with many American critics of Keystone XL, which is being proposed by TransCanada, British Columbia said that much remained unknown about how bitumen behaved after spills, particularly in water.After it first appeared that the approval of Keystone XL might be in jeopardy, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who represents an Alberta political constituency in Parliament, began heavily promoting the Northern Gateway project as a way of diversifying Canada's energy business . The United States is Canada's only export customer .But the Northern Gateway project is unpopular in southern British Columbia, where the majority of the province's population lives, and was an issue in recent provincial elections .While the decision to grant Enbridge a permit ultimately rests with Mr. Harper's federal government, several environmental groups said that the province's opposition had probably doomed the pipeline .Gillian McEachern, campaign director for Environmental Defence, a Canadian advocacy group, said that the federal government \"would be ill advised\" to override the provincial government . \"Projects that work are ones that clearly have support of people in the region,\" she said.In a statement, Joe Oliver, federal natural resources minister, did not directly address the province's concerns. But he said, \"The objective of diversifying our export markets for energy remains a critical priority for our government .\"Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that any attempt to impose the pipeline on the province would raise several constitutional questions. Not only do the two governments have overlapping and sometimes conflicting powers over environmental issues, but also most of the land that the pipeline would cross is owned by the provincial government .Any legal challenge by the province, she said, \"could be tied up in the courts for some time.\""}
{"_id": 14, "text": "WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection Agency will propose a rule on Friday that will cut the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline by two thirds to improve the performance of the catalytic converters in engines that fight smog, the agency has told refiners and clean air advocates.The proposal has been ready for about 15 months but was delayed until after the election because opponents will argue that it will raise the price of gasoline, according to people familiar with its history.\"They didn't want to have a big fight during an election year,\" said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.The rule will essentially move the country to the sulfur standards now in place in California, Mr. Becker said. Refiners said it could raise the price of a gallon by 6 to 8 cents, but clean air groups said it would be more like 1 cent. The difference depends in part on details of the rule that have not been made public.News of the proposal was first reported by The Washington Post on its Web site . Gasoline in the other 49 states can now have up to 30 parts of sulfur per million, and the proposed rule will be. The main problem is that at the current level, sulfur reduces the effectiveness of the catalytic converter, which eliminates nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide .Charles T. Drevna, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refiners' main trade association, said the companies had in the last few years cut the sulfur content by 90 percent, to 30 parts from 300 parts, at a cost of 10 billion in capital improvements. He said that the proposed cut would cost another 10 billion. Because the process consumes energy, it will raise the carbon dioxide output of refineries .Mr. Drevna said that the E.P.A. had not demonstrated that the cut was needed to meet existing air quality standards. He said he was hoping the industry would have time to respond.But Mr. Becker said that when put in place, the rule would cut nitrogen oxide emissions by,000 tons, compared with about 10 million tons from all mobile sources. That is the equivalent of 33 million cars, he said.The cut, Mr. Becker said, was huge, more than the E.P.A. was seeking from its cross state air pollution rule, a major initiative that was blocked by a court ruling last year."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "Farmers, waste management companies and the energy industries have long experimented with converting methane, a byproduct of decomposing organic matter, into transportation fuel .Those efforts have met with mixed success, and a renewable natural gas fuel has not been widely available in the United States . But now, one leading supplier of natural gas transport fuel is taking a big step toward changing that. Clean Energy Fuels will announce on Thursday that it has started selling a fuel made of methane from landfills and other waste sources at its more than 40 filling stations in California . The company, which is backed by T. Boone Pickens, is developing a nationwide network of natural gas pumps and plans to introduce the fuel elsewhere as well. The company expects to sell 15 million gallons of the fuel in California this year, more than double the amount of similar fuels the Environmental Protection Agency projected would be produced nationwide.Its customers include companies like AT T, Verizon, Mattel and Williams Sonoma as well as large fleet operators like SuperShuttle and Hertz.To many in the industry, the pace of the fuel's development has been something of a surprise.\"Though California and others have been investing in the development of this fuel, I don't think people were expecting there to be a significant public supply or access this soon maybe not even this decade,\" said Tim Carmichael, who leads the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, a trade group .A big factor in methane's rise is the surge in natural gas production from shale drilling, which had already nudged the transportation industry to begin shifting to vehicles that can run on the cleaner burning fuel, making it easier to meet emissions standards.Another reason is powerful government incentives, especially in California, that have imposed strict regulations intended to help reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by. Under the program, suppliers that reduce emissions during the production, transportation and use of the fuel are awarded tradable credits.These and similar federal incentives are allowing Clean Energy to sell the fuel, which is called Redeem, at the same price as its conventional natural gas fuel even though it is more expensive to produce.The new fuel is also cheaper than diesel fuel and it provides the companies some insulation from the geopolitics that can drive up petroleum prices.But because of its source, the fuel counts as renewable and takes less energy to extract and process, making it more attractive to companies seeking to burnish their green credentials.The fuel's environmental benefits also include capturing the methane before it is released into the atmosphere. When the methane derived fuel is burned, it is far less harmful to the atmosphere than petroleum fuels . But the methane that escapes directly from decomposing waste is more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon .For this reason, many large scale farms, wastewater treatment companies and garbage companies have developed systems to capture escaping methane known as biogas for both transportation and electricity, and several start up companies are working on systems of their own. There are projects in Europe as well, where biogas for transport is more common.Although many of the methane capture projects in the United States and Europe have been geared toward producing electricity, those markets have been declining, said Mackinnon Lawrence, principal research analyst at Navigant Research.Looking to make transportation fuel was a logical alternative, he said, because producers can take advantage of federal and state incentives . The push has its risks, however, because the credit values have been so volatile that it is difficult for companies to commit to long term investments.Beyond the bottom line, customers are increasingly interested in how clean the fuel is, said Andrew J. Littlefair, the chief executive of Clean Energy, adding that Redeem can burn 90 percent cleaner than diesel. \"We're seeing from these heavy duty trucking fleets, and these shippers that hire these trucking fleets, they're really interested in sustainability,\" he said. \"It's gotten to be a very important part of the sale.\"John Simourian, chief executive of Lily Transportation, which uses a nationwide network of trucks to move a range of products, including construction materials and groceries, said that only a small portion of his fleet ran on natural gas but that the company was shifting over.Not only is the fuel less expensive, but it gives the company a competitive advantage with customers on price and environmental concerns . \"It's just a win all around,\" he said."}

When it originally opened in, the chilly passageway was intended to bring liquefied natural gas from large tankers onshore to the Dominion Cove Point facility, where it was warmed, turned back into gas and sent on to customers .But Cove Point has had a sporadic history and has not been visited by a tanker for delivery since 2011 thanks to reduced U.S. demand for natural gas .Now, Dominion Transmission wants to reverse the flow. It is seeking regulatory approval for a plan to invest.8 billion so that Cove Point could cool U.S. gas to 265 degrees Fahrenheit ( 165 Celsius) and export the resulting L.N.G. The company has already signed 20 year contracts with utilities in Japan and India . Thomas F. Farrell, chief executive of Dominion Resources, which owns the facility, said Cove Point, which has easy access to the Marcellus shale fields in Pennsylvania, was \" cost effective and environmentally compatible.\"Dominion is just one of many companies now seeking approval to export L.N.G. from about 20 upgraded or new facilities in the United States . The companies want to take advantage of the recent flood of cheap shale gas brought on by advanced drilling techniques and helped by the extensive American domestic pipeline network .\"You have an abundance of reserves and a tremendous infrastructure to move molecules around the lower 48 states and Canada,\" said Jamie Welch, chief financial officer of Energy Transfer Equity, based in Dallas .Mr. Welch's company along with its partners, BG Group of Britain and Lake Charles Exports have recently won federal regulatory permission to build an 11 billion L.N.G. export station in Lake Charles, Louisiana .American L.N.G is clearly going to be exported, but how much of an impact those exports will have on global markets is a matter of intense interest and debate. Global annual consumption today is about 240 million tons, but some analysts forecast that demand will more than double to 550 million tons annually by. If all of the proposed plants are built, the U.S. could supply 200 million tons, or almost half of world demand, in one highly optimistic estimate .If that happens, \"of course it will have an impact,\" says Philippe Sauquet, head of the gas and power division of Total, the French oil and gas giant. L.N.G. prices around the world might be affected, putting pressure on projects worth tens of billions of dollars already under way in places like Australia.But many analysts say exports will wind up being more modest. Jean Marie Dauger, executive vice president of GDF Suez, the French utility, said that perhaps 10 or 12 of the U.S. plants would be built, with an output of about,000 tons annually. \"This volume will not be sufficient to impact prices in Asia,\" he said.Still, Mr. Dauger describes the overall L.N.G. market as \"booming.\" Natural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal, the dominant fuel in Asian markets like China, and the world nuclear power industry has not yet recovered from the Fukushima nuclear disaster of. Meanwhile, new uses for L.N.G. are emerging, including for powering ships and heavy trucks.Even before the American shale gas revolution, global energy firms had been scrambling to come up with new L.N.G. facilities to tap remote fields from Australia to Angola to the Russian Arctic. Companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total are planning up to 400 billion in L.N.G. investments around the world. In the dry outback of Australia and in the jungles of New Guinea, the price of building L.N.G. facilities can be as high as,500 per ton of an L.N.G. plant's annual capacity, Mr. Welch said.Those cost levels make America look very attractive. L.N.G. plants on the drawing board in the United States are likely to cost about 700 per ton.Besides construction costs, domestic natural gas prices in the United States of about 4 per million British thermal units are low enough that L.N.G. from America would cost a small fraction of the 15 to 20 per million B.T.U.'s that Asian buyers now pay.These advantages are creating interest among Asian buyers including Mitsui, Sumitomo, Korea Gas, India's GAIL Global and Osaka Gas . With Europe's economy stagnant and the United States in oversupply, more gas is heading to Asia .The U.S. push is changing the business model for L.N.G. For years, shipping the fuel was a simple point to point operation with tankers carrying liquefied gas to a specific terminal."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "IF you could close your eyes for just a moment like Rip Van Winkle, and blink them open in, you might see a very different energy world. Electric cars may be popular. Solar energy could be cheap enough that millions of households and businesses deploy solar panels to generate their power needs. Fossil fuels will probably still dominate, but most trucks and many trains could run on natural gas rather than more polluting diesel. And the United States could be a major oil exporter .None of this is implausible. Consider the change over the last 10 years. Back in, American natural gas fields were thought to be drying up and energy entrepreneurs were beginning to invest in hugely expensive terminals to import gas, not export it. American oil production continued to plummet.An awakening Rip today would see a miraculous change a country on the path to becoming energy independent, a hopelessly quixotic quest only a decade ago . Newly prolific oil fields in North Dakota and Texas are expanding domestic production to levels not seen in a generation. The United States has suddenly become a net exporter of gasoline and diesel fuel . And it is looking for new markets for natural gas as well new drilling technologies have allowed domestic production to soar over the last five years, causing a glut and price slump.\"When it comes to energy, the rule of the game is to expect the unexpected,\" said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. \"So much effort is going into research, development and innovation all across the energy spectrum, 10 years from now we may well see the next game changer .\"Possibly profound changes are taking shape right now. Newly mandated corporate average fuel economy standards are expected to double the number of miles that the average car travels per gallon by. Scientists are working to develop better ways to store electricity to make wind turbines and solar power systems more practical when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine. Energy poor Japan has just found a way to extract natural gas from frozen methane hydrate at the bottom of the sea, a development that could open the door to a giant new gas source around the world.Development of advanced biofuels, made of nonfood materials like algae and switch grass, has been disappointingly slow over the last decade. But breakthroughs are still possible. The first United States commercial advanced biofuels plant opened last fall in Mississippi, and a handful more are expected to start producing 200 million gallons this year. Tesoro, the Texas based refiner, has agreed to begin buying algae derived fuel to produce diesel.A handful of power plants designed to convert coal into combustible gas, which could emit half the carbon dioxide of conventional coal fired plants, are in the planning stages. Bill Gates is investing heavily in a company called TerraPower, which is working on a fission reactor that, unlike reactors that use enriched uranium and need to be refueled, could run on its own nuclear waste thus reducing the threat of proliferation and extending the life of available uranium supplies.\"The room for innovation is simply mind blowing,\" Mr. Gates told executives at a recent conference in Houston held by IHS Cera, the energy consulting firm . \"Frankly, we need hundreds of ideas because many of them won't succeed.\"Some changes are fairly easy to predict, given the momentum of the current transformations, especially the emergence of natural gas as a dominant fuel both in the United States and abroad . It is entirely possible, if not likely, that American truck fleets, and perhaps even trains, will replace diesel with cleaner burning natural gas . The rail freight giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the country's biggest diesel consumer, plans to test liquefied natural gas in its engines. Plans are afoot to convert idle natural gas import terminals into export terminals that could make the United States a major gas exporter by the early 2020s.Modular gas to liquids plants will probably emerge next to oil fields, to exploit natural gas that is now being released and wastefully flared the gas can instead be converted into a diesel fuel to power rigs and trucks. Government regulations will force energy companies to adopt safeguards against air and water pollution from hydraulic fracturing . And just as the exploitation of shale gas and oil production has taken off in the United States over the last decade, the next chapter of this revolution will see its expansion across much of the globe over the next decade, from Argentina and Mexico to China and North Africa . ENVIRONMENTALISTS and fossil fuel producers have different wish lists for the future, of course, but many in both groups see the potential for big and somewhat similar energy changes over the next decade.Hal Harvey, chief executive of Energy Innovation, an environmental consulting firm based in San Francisco, conceded that transportation fuels \"are not going to change that much in the next 10 years.\" But he said the new auto fuel standards would produce a striking improvement in mileage efficiency as carmakers design far lighter vehicles of new or improved materials that provide strength and safety without mass.He also foresees \" explosive growth \" in renewable energy sources for electricity, with wind generation systems now running at a cost below that of many older power plants, and costs of solar energy panels coming down by 70 percent over the last three years. \"We are going to see a lot of change in power generation over the next 10 years,\" he said. \"You start to give homeowners the opportunity to self generate and control their energy costs, and they take that option.\"He noted that California utilities had already signed contracts to comply with a state mandate to produce one third of their power from renewables by, from roughly 20 percent today. \"The forces are inexorable,\" he concluded.William Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president for corporate strategic planning, similarly said that \" oil is going to continue to be dominant in transportation\" over the next 10 years at least.Nevertheless, he said there should be many more hybrid vehicles on the road by. \"They will be more popular for one reason Governments are mandating higher economy standards,\" Mr. Colton said. \"The industry will be pushed in that direction.\"Mr. Colton said natural gas would become increasingly important in the power sector, replacing much coal burning both in the United States and abroad . He also foresees possible scientific breakthroughs for building lighter, cheaper and faster charging batteries for cars biological breakthroughs to make biofuel production more economical and even advances in the development of hydrogen fuel cells to run electric motors on cars, resulting in emissions of only water vapor. But he added that commercialization of any of the possible breakthroughs would take at least another decade.Much of the future of energy will depend on government policy, of course, and several major decisions in the United States are coming soon."}
{"_id": 14, "text": "One reason that offshore wind has not caught on in the United States is the steep cost of erecting a tower in the water, but researchers at the University of Maine tried another approach on Friday by launching a floating wind machine. It is the first offshore wind installation in United States waters, according to the Energy Department, which helped pay for it.The tower, launched in Brewer, Me., sits on three hollow concrete tubes and will be anchored in the Gulf of Maine . It is a mere 20 kilowatts in capacity, an amount of power that could be soaked up by a handful of big suburban houses on a hot summer day. But it is one eighth the dimensions of the one the researchers hope to deploy in the next few years, a gigantic 6 megawatt model, with each blade as long as the wingspan of a Boeing.Because of its location, it will have two big advantages over machines on land, according to Habib J. Dagher, a professor of civil engineering at the university. Onshore wind machines produce most of their energy at night, when it is least valuable to utilities buying the power, but this one will catch the predictable, strong breezes that come up every sunny summer afternoon, he said, when the sun heats the land more than the sea, creating an onshore breeze.Over a year, onshore machines in the Eastern United States produce only about a third as much electricity as would result if they ran at full tilt every hour of the year, but this one will produce 40 percent to 50 percent as much, he said, because winds offshore are stronger.The engineering, though, is tricky for one thing, the tip of the tower will swing on the waves. But the platform is designed to rock at a slower rate than the waves to lessen their impact.The project is one of seven sponsored by the Energy Department under a 168 million program. Three are floating, four are fixed, and this is the first to be put into use, according to Jose Zayas, director of the department's Wind and Water Power Technologies office.The Friday project is small but \"it's important to recognize it is at a relevant scale,\" he said. \"It does represent the behaviors and dynamics of a large machine.\"Among the issues is durability Mr. Dagher said the concrete would not corrode and should last 60 years, just as the Hoover Dam had proven durable over many decades. The offshore wind resource is equivalent to thousands of Hoover Dams, he said.\"The beauty of the floating technology is it doesn't care what the water depths are,\" Mr. Dagher said. The platform bears some resemblance to the ones the oil industry uses to drill from.Water is shallow off most of the East Coast but not off Maine, and not off much of California's coast, experts say. Peter Mandelstam, a wind developer and longtime chairman of the American Wind Energy Association's offshore group, said, \"We and other developers want this technology developed on both coasts.\""}
{"_id": 14, "text": "Over the years, as Rick Murphy helped expand his family's auto business in Edina, Minn., outside Minneapolis, he wanted to install solar panels to cut the electricity bills, but the upfront cost was too high.Then a developer, Blue Horizon Energy, made a proposal Grandview Tire and Auto, using a new loan program, could borrow the,000 to install the system and pay it back over 10 years, but instead of making traditional loan payments, they would be made through his property taxes .Now, with 117 panels on one of his five stores, he is saving,600 a year and bringing in new customers attracted to the company's green image.The program, he said, \"made the concept of adding solar to our business reality.\"After years of fits, starts and unanticipated pitfalls, the long term loan program championed by the White House but stymied by federal housing officials is gaining traction across the country, especially among businesses like Grandview. Known as Property Assessed Clean Energy financing, the approach allows owners to borrow the money for conservation or clean energy upgrades and pay it back over the long haul, often 20 years, through a property tax surcharge.Since June, the number of projects completed with the financing has more than doubled, to at least 168 worth 33 million, from 75 worth 10 million, according to PACENow, a nonprofit advocacy group that tracks the programs. The group says that 30 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing the program, and estimates that the number of projects could easily double by the end of next year.And the approach is on the verge of becoming more widespread. A week ago, Gov . Rick Perry of Texas signed legislation that would allow more commercial and industrial projects to go forward. Texas joins seven other states that are amending their laws this year to allow the financing, while several local and state governments, including Connecticut, Sacramento, Miami and Atlanta, either have new districts with loan programs or soon will.\"It's an idea that resonates and is catching on,\" said David Gabrielson, the PACENow executive director . \"I see encouraging signs in the build out of a whole new approach to funding energy efficiency .\"Despite the program's growth among businesses, the group it was originally intended for homeowners is still largely left out. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees financing for two thirds of new residential mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, does not allow those agencies to buy mortgages for properties with liens that have a higher priority for payback, as PACE loans often do. Local governments have long used special taxing districts to finance improvements to private property that benefit the public. The idea behind PACE was to turn that idea toward upgrades like new windows and insulation or solar arrays that often cost more than property owners could pay upfront but less than they would save on electricity bills over time. Berkeley, Calif., pioneered the concept in, and it quickly expanded, sometimes with the help of grants from the Department of Energy to pilot projects in several towns and states across the country.But the program hit a snag in 2010 when the F.H.F.A., under pressure to improve its balance sheet during the housing crisis, derailed the program largely because in most cases the PACE loans would have to be repaid before the mortgages during a foreclosure . Congressional and legal challenges to the agency's rulings have failed to overturn them, but advocates remain hopeful that a federal policy change could open up the loans to more homeowners.\"What's frustrating is when there's something which is an obvious win it's not even contentious and it doesn't go forward,\" said Dan Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped design and study early PACE programs."}
{"_id": 15, "text": "WASHINGTON Wholesalers cut back on restocking in May even as sales rose, indicating that economic growth could pick up later this year as they rebuild their stockpiles.The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale stockpiles shrank.5 percent in May, the most in 20 months. That followed a.1 percent decline in April, which was revised lower.Sales at the wholesale level increased.6 percent in May and.7 percent in April.A reduction in stockpiles may prompt economists to cut their growth forecasts for the April June quarter . But the steady gain in sales suggests companies may have to order more goods in the coming months to keep up with demand . That could bolster factory production and drive more economic growth in the second half of the year. Auto sales jumped 3 percent in May, yet stockpiles were unchanged. And sales of durable goods, items meant to last at least three years, rose.3 percent, while inventories of those goods fell by the same amount.Sales of nondurable goods rose.8 percent, the most in more than two years. The gain was caused by large increases in sales of clothing, groceries and pharmaceuticals. Stockpiles of those goods declined.8 percent.Stockpiles of farm goods fell sharply for the second straight month, dropping 6 percent. That most likely reflected the impact of a severe drought last year, which has resulted in lower stockpiles this spring.Overall wholesale stockpiles totaled.9 billion in May, 3.3 percent higher than a year ago.Much of the recent data suggest the second half of the year could be stronger, helped by steady job growth, a resilient consumer and a sustained recovery in housing. Employers have added,000 jobs a month through the first six months of the year. That is up from,000 in the previous six months.More Americans are earning paychecks, which increases overall income and supports more spending ."}
{"_id": 15, "text": "American employers have a variety of job vacancies, piles of cash and countless well qualified candidates . But despite a slowly improving economy, many companies remain reluctant to actually hire, stringing job applicants along for weeks or months before they make a decision.If they ever do.The number of job openings has increased to levels not seen since the height of the financial crisis, but vacancies are staying unfilled much longer than they used to an average of 23 business days today compared to a low of 15 in mid, according to a new measure of Labor Department data by the economists Steven J. Davis, Jason Faberman and John Haltiwanger.Some have attributed the more extended process to a mismatch between the requirements of the four million jobs available and the skills held by many of the 12 million unemployed. That's probably true in a few high skilled fields, like nursing or biotech, but for a large majority of positions where candidates are plentiful, the bigger problem seems to be a sort of hiring paralysis.\"There's a fear that the economy is going to go down again, so the message you get from C.F.O.'s is to be careful about hiring someone,\" said John Sullivan, a management professor at San Francisco State University who runs a human resources consulting business . \"There's this great fear of making a mistake, of wasting money in a tight economy .\"As a result, employers are bringing in large numbers of candidates for interview after interview after interview. Data from Glassdoor.com, a site that collects information on hiring at different companies, shows that the average duration of the interview process at major companies like Starbucks, General Mills and Southwest Airlines has roughly doubled since.\"After they call you back after the sixth interview, there's a part of you that wants to say, 'That's it, I'm not going back,' \" said Paul Sullivan, 43, an exasperated but cheerful video editor in Washington . \"But then you think, hey, maybe seven is my lucky number. And besides, if I don't go, they'll just eliminate me if something else comes up because they'll think I have an attitude problem.\"Like other job seekers around the country, he has been through marathon interview sessions. Mr. Sullivan has received eighth and ninth round callbacks for positions at three different companies . Two of those companies, as it turned out, ultimately decided not to hire anyone, he said instead they put their openings \"on hold\" because of budget pressures.At one company, while signing into the visitor's log for the sixth time, he was chided by the security guard .\"He thought I worked there and just kept forgetting my security badge,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"He couldn't believe I was actually there for another interview. I couldn't either! But then I put on a happy face, went upstairs and waited for another round of questions.\"The hiring delays are part of the vicious cycle the economy has yet to escape jobless and financially stretched Americans are reluctant to spend, which holds back demand, which in turn frays employers' confidence that sales will firm up and justify committing to a new hire. Job creation over the last two years has been steady but too slow to put a major dent in the backlog of unemployed workers, and the February jobs report due out on Friday is expected to be equally mediocre. Uncertainty about the effect of fiscal policy in Washington is not helping expectations for the rest of the year, either.\"If you have an opening and are not sure about the economy, it's pretty cheap to wait for a month or two,\" said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University . But in the aggregate, those little delays, coupled with fiscal uncertainty, are stretching out the recovery process. \"It's like one of those horror movies, an economic Friday the 13th, where this recession never seems to die.\" Employers might be making candidates jump through so many hoops partly because so many workers have been jobless for months or years, and hiring managers want to make sure the candidates' skills are up to date, said Robert Shimer, an economics professor at the University of Chicago .But there's also little pressure to hire right now, so long as candidates are abundant and existing staff members are afraid to refuse the extra workload created by an unfilled position. Employers can keep dragging out the hiring process until they're more confident about their business or at least until they find the superstar candidate.\"They're chasing after that purple squirrel,\" said Roger Ahlfeld, 44, of Framingham, Mass., using a human resources industry term for an impossibly qualified job applicant."}

{"_id": 15, "text": "Americans cut back on spending in February as cold weather and economic strain chilled their appetite for spring merchandise, retailers reported on Thursday.The nation's retailers said sales slowed in February, when most stores get rid of winter merchandise and bring in swimsuits, ankle length pants and other spring fashions. Americans are dealing with a payroll tax increase of two percentage points, income tax refunds that came later than usual and high gas prices . Widespread winter storms may also have made spring merchandise less appealing to them.\"February was a difficult month,\" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm . \" Retailers faced significant headwinds .\"The numbers reflect a drop in sales growth from January. Over all, 14 retailers reported that revenue at stores open at least a year an indicator of retail health rose an average of.1 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry trade group . That compares with increases of.1 percent in January and.7 percent last February.But the latest results were affected by a drop in the number of stores reporting monthly sales, including the loss of big names like Target and Macy's.With the shrinking list, Costco, which posted a 6 percent gain in February, now accounts for about two thirds of the tally. The retailers that report monthly data represent only about 6 percent of the.4 trillion in annual United States retail industry sales.Among the companies that reported monthly results, the ones that cater to poor and middle class shoppers said that Americans were still grappling with economic challenges . Many retailers resorted to steep discounts to attract shoppers .\"February sales reflect the continuing difficult economic environment,\" said John Cato, chief executive of Cato, a women's clothing chain. \"We did see some beneficial impact from the delay in tax refunds from January.\"Limited Brands Inc., which operates Victoria's Secret and has been on a winning streak, said that it had to discount more heavily than usual to bring in shoppers in February. Still, it reported a 3 percent increase in revenue, above the.6 percent rise analysts had expected . Gap Inc ., which started to gain momentum early last year, had a mixed performance. The retailer, which operates Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, posted a 3 percent increase, higher than the 2 percent gain analysts had projected. Revenue rose 2 percent at Gap and 6 percent at Old Navy, but sales at Banana Republic stores open at least a year fell 5 percent."}
{"_id": 15, "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) After dropping in March, retail sales unexpectedly eked out a.1 percent gain in April, pointing to underlying strength in the economy and leading forecasters to raise estimates of second quarter growth .The gain in retail sales, which account for about 30 percent of consumer spending, was the latest sign of resilience in an economy that has been hit by belt tightening in Washington as the government tries to cut the budget deficit .\"It's more indication that our economy is growing,\" said Thomas Hall, an economics professor at Miami University's Farmer School of Business in Oxford, Ohio . \"It's not growing as rapidly as a lot of people would like, but things are improving.\" Retail sales rose after a.5 percent drop in March as consumers bought cars, building materials and a variety of other goods, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Economists had expected a decrease of.3 percent.Core sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline and building materials, were up.5 percent after an upwardly revised.1 percent gain in March. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's tally of gross domestic product . February core sales also were revised higher.On the heels of data showing relatively sturdy job growth in the last three months, the increase in core sales helped to allay fears of an abrupt economic slowdown . Several economists raised second quarter growth estimates based on the fairly strong number. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast by three tenths of a percentage point to a.1 percent annual rate, while JPMorgan raised its estimate by half a point to 2 percent.The Commerce Department also reported, however, that business inventories in March were flat for a second consecutive month, suggesting that restocking was probably not as big an addition to growth in the first three months of the year as initially thought . But the lack of inventory accumulation could add to second quarter growth as businesses are likely to restock to meet steady demand . Growth is being limited by the end of a 2 percent payroll tax cut and higher tax rates on large incomes, which began on Jan. 1. Widespread government spending cuts worth 85 billion also are weighing on consumption.But gasoline prices, which fell 14 cents in April, helped to offset the drag on household income, freeing money for discretionary spending .Economists also said the Federal Reserve's campaign to keep interest rates low was helping households, in part by raising stock prices and home values .\"Those who doubt that the Federal Reserve is making an impact just need to look at debt restructuring and wealth effects on spending,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago . \"There is no way the consumer would be holding up so well without the support of lower interest rates.\"The components of the retail sales report were mostly firm . Receipts at auto dealerships rose 1 percent after falling.6 percent in March. Though falling gas prices reduced receipts at gas stations, sales excluding gasoline had their largest increase since December. Without gas and autos, sales rose .6 percent."}
{"_id": 15, "text": "WASHINGTON Employment has been increasing at a healthy clip for the last few months, but the Federal Reserve is not ready to relax just yet.\"We need to see sustained improvement,\" the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"One or two months doesn't cut it. So we're just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see how things evolve.\" The Fed's policy making committee said much the same thing in a stilted statement issued just before Mr. Bernanke took questions, announcing that it would continue to hold down short term interest rates and buy 85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities .Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed would reduce its asset purchases if job growth continued at the current pace, the first time he has said that the central bank is likely to reduce the amount of monthly purchases before it stops buying entirely.But such a change remains at least a few months away, and quite possibly longer. The Fed is wary of pulling back too soon, a mistake it has already made several times in recent years . It is waiting to assess the impact of the federal spending cuts that began this month. And Mr. Bernanke said the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes policy for the Fed, \"have not been able to come to an agreement\" about the goals of the asset purchases or, by extension, when they should end.Mr. Bernanke, who has made job growth the Fed's top priority for the first time in its 100 year history, spoke about the issue in personal terms. Asked when he last had spoken to an unemployed person, he said that one of his own relatives was out of work.\"I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession,\" Mr. Bernanke said. \"The last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent. The home I was raised in had just been foreclosed upon. I have a great concern for the unemployed, both for their own sake but also because the loss of skills and the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy .\"Mr. Bernanke also may have provided some insight into his own future. Asked repeatedly about his interest in a third term as Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke demurred several times before telling one reporter, \"I've spoken to the president a bit but I really don't have any information for you at this juncture.\"The Fed said last year that it planned to hold short term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above.5 percent. The rate stood at.7 percent in February and has barely budged in half a year. Most economic forecasters do not expect the threshold to be reached before.The asset purchases are intended as a short term measure to catalyze faster job growth the Fed has said it will slow increasing its collection of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, a policy known as \" quantitative easing,\" once it is convinced that employment is increasing at a sustainable pace.The unusual rigidity of this basic course has diminished the importance of the Fed's regular meetings, and it has to some extent created a problem of foreshortening. The next change in policy is necessarily the major subject of discussion among Fed officials, analysts and investors . But that may make the next change seem nearer than it really is. It is quite possible that the year could pass without any significant change.\"In one line Sustainability, sustainability, sustainability,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, wrote in a note to clients . \"Mr. Bernanke clearly does not want even to consider slowing Q.E. until he is convinced that any such run of strength now is a permanent shift.\"The decision, of course, does not rest with Mr. Bernanke alone. And he noted on Wednesday that there was no consensus on the policy making committee about how much longer asset purchases should continue. \"We've not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give,\" he said.As is often the case, Fed officials are not just debating how to respond to economic circumstances. They are debating the nature of those circumstances.The economy has grown more robustly in recent months the committee hailed \"a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year\" and job growth has increased since the Fed began its latest stimulus campaign in September.But even as spending by consumers and businesses drives growth, the Fed noted that fiscal policy \"has become somewhat more restrictive.\"\"The committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook,\" the statement said.The Fed separately released economic forecasts by 19 of its senior officials showing that their expectations had actually soured slightly. They predicted growth of.3 percent to.8 percent this year, down from a forecast in December of.3 percent to 3 percent. The consensus forecast for 2014 also fell. Officials now expect growth of.9 percent to.4 percent in, compared with a December forecast of growth from 3 percent to.5 percent.Concerns about inflation remained in abeyance. Fed officials do not expect inflation above 2 percent over the next three years, well below their self imposed ceiling of.5 percent inflation . At the same time, officials were modestly more optimistic about job growth . They predicted that the unemployment rate would rest between.7 and 7 percent at the end of. In December, they predicted that the rate would sit between.8 and.3 percent at the end of.Against concerns that the pace of growth remains subpar, the Fed continues to weigh the possibility that its efforts will destabilize financial markets by encouraging excessive risk taking .So far, support on the committee for the stimulus remains strong. The decision to press forward was supported by 11 of the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee . Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, recorded the only dissent, as she did in January, citing concerns about stability and future inflation ."}

Economists expected a flat reading.Underscoring the benign inflation environment, consumer prices rose just.5 percent in the 12 months through March the smallest increase since July. Prices increased 2 percent year on year in February.Stripping out volatile energy and food costs, the so called core C.P.I. was up only.1 percent after gaining.2 percent in February.

The decline was fairly broad based, with output dropping for primary metals and electronics. Automobile assembly, however, increased.Despite the factory weakness, overall industrial production rose.4 percent last month, mainly because of a jump in utilities' output. Economic data for January and February have suggested growth accelerated in the first quarter after activity almost stalled in the final three months of.But in a replay of the previous two years, the economy appears to have hit a speed bump at the end of the quarter, with data ranging from employment to retail sales and manufacturing weakening significantly in March.Much of the weakness is blamed on higher taxes and deep government spending cuts put in place in Washington .\"We definitely see the second quarter slowing from the first in terms of overall growth across many of the sectors. Obviously, the drag from fiscal policy is playing into this a little bit,\" said Erik Johnson, senior United States economist at IHS Global Insight .A third report from the Commerce Department showed that housing starts rose.0 percent last month to a.04 million unit annual rate, the highest in nearly five years.The increase in home building was driven by the volatile multifamily sector, while groundbreaking for single family units fell.

{"_id": 15, "text": "WASHINGTON Congress's 85 billion, across the board budget cuts may not have brought the economy to a halt, as many once feared. But they are having a negative effect on jobs in the private sector, according to an analysis of the industries whose head count is most dependent on federal funds .It is no surprise that some of the companies that are hurting are closely associated with military spending, which was specifically targeted to absorb about half of the cuts from the so called sequester that began March. But many of the businesses experiencing the most pain are those that provide a wide range of services, like plumbing and maintenance.\"We're kind of invisible,\" says Robert M. Sacco, general manager of Aleut Facilities Support Services, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., \"until your toilet overflows.\"Contractors say they are trying to make do by picking up other projects where they can, but private sector and state and local government demand has also been weak or shrinking in recent years . Many in the facilities support field, a business category that includes janitorial, maintenance, trash disposal, guard and security, mail routing, reception and laundry services, say they are frustrated by the lack of public awareness about how defense budget cuts affect workers who are not performing stereotypical military functions.\"They just kind of left us hanging,\" said James M. Galligan, chief executive and founder of Strategic Consulting Alliances, a small business in Maryland that employs veterans to do things like clean bathrooms and repair roofs on government properties. \"In midstream the government just sort of cut its funding in half, but I, of course, still have to pay for my workers' health care and taxes and everything else.\"As a result, he resorted to layoffs earlier this year that brought his total payroll down to 50 from about.Mr. Galligan's and Mr. Sacco's companies both provide facilities support services about 43 percent of the sector's jobs are directly or indirectly paid for by military and other national security operations .That makes it one of top five sectors that are most reliant on military spending to pay employees. The others in the top five are ship and boat building aerospace product and parts manufacturing scientific research and development services and navigational, measuring, electromedical and control instruments manufacturing, based on calculations by The New York Times using Labor Department methodology. (The calculations involve looking at which industries receive government allocations, and then determine where hiring occurs when production rises or falls in one of those industries. For example, if the Pentagon spends money on fighter planes, that affects employment in the aerospace industry as well as upstream companies like metal manufacturers .)\"There is a huge amount of public sector employment today that is actually in the private sector,\" said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan . \"Who is a public sector worker used to be a simple thing and now it's not.\"Across the five industries that are most sensitive to changes in military spending, employment fell at an annual rate of.5 percent in March and stayed flat in April, the latest month for which seasonally adjusted data are available. In all other sectors, by contrast, employment grew at annualized rates of about.6 percent in March and.7 percent in April.Before the start of the sequester on March, employment at private companies heavily dependent on military spending had been more closely tracking employment in the rest of the economy, though the numbers were somewhat uneven. Military payrolls have been declining almost every month since November 2011 in response to the drawdown in American wars abroad.These are just the sectors that are most directly hit by Pentagon cutbacks economists fear that the sequester will ripple through the rest of the economy in more subtle ways, as downsized or furloughed government workers and contractors spend less money at their local businesses . The federal government has shed,000 jobs since the sequester began, and federal workers who were working part time but wanted full time work numbered,000 in May, up from,000 a year earlier. Government cutbacks, not just the sequester and other federal budget cuts but also several years of state and local government layoffs, appear to be an important factor in holding back the economic expansion . \"The great puzzle in this recovery is why it's not quicker, particularly relative to other recoveries,\" Mr. Wolfers said. \"The sequester is one of the many insults that been hurled at the recovery so far.\"Some government contractors said that their problems started even before the sequester officially began in March, partly because months of debate over Congressional budget cuts made government agencies and military bases wary about how much money they'd have available to spend.In May, for example, Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque reduced the number of times it had its bathrooms and other facilities cleaned from every other day to twice a week, according to Brian Ammerman, associate vice president of business operations at Adelante Enterprises, a nonprofit that employs people with disabilities and whose facilities support services division holds the custodial contract with Kirtland.In other cases, new contracts have been delayed, including projects to make government buildings more energy efficient . \"There are expected jobs that we've been tracking for several years that we knew were supposed to hit in the first quarter of this year that we haven't seen yet,\" said Dave Mannix, director of the federal market for Sebesta Blomberg, another firm that has facilities management and other technical and engineering contracts with both public and private sector clients . \"There were things that were supposed to be up for contract in the second quarter, and we haven't seen those yet either.\"Even companies that have not been affected so far are concerned about the pipeline for future government work.\" Fiscal year 2014 is going to be a bad year,\" said Mario Burgos, president of the Burgos Group, a small business in Albuquerque that provides a variety of technical, administrative and management services to federal clients, including the Navy, the Air Force and the Bureau of Land Management . \"The largest amount of contract awards comes in this last fiscal quarter, which ends in September. Well, that's also the time that the government employees who make those award decisions, who get those contracts out, are all being furloughed.\"Mr. Burgos said his company had been enjoying a good year so far, mostly by casting its net more broadly and bidding on contracts at agencies the company had not previously worked for. Nonetheless, he has resisted expanding because of uncertainty over the next federal fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, and whether existing contracts, typically awarded on a five or 10 year basis, might be canceled.\"It really makes us hesitant to invest in infrastructure, like additional people or additional tools, since we don't know what could be taken away,\" he said. \"Usually one of the nice things about federal contracting is that you can plan on a longer time frame, as opposed to with business to business projects where somebody new gets hired and then they change their mind about the project. But now even in government work we don't know what's going to happen month to month.\""}
{"_id": 15, "text": "WASHINGTON Just a few months after announcing a campaign to reduce unemployment, Federal Reserve officials are already debating how soon to stop it, reflecting persistent internal divisions about the effort's value.At a meeting in December, several members of the Fed's policy making committee argued that purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities should be reduced or ended \"well before the end of,\" according to an account of the meeting the Fed published Thursday after a customary three week delay. The Fed announced after the meeting that it would keep buying assets until the pace of job creation improved substantially, part of an effort to increase the impact of its policies by announcing economic objectives rather than end dates. But the account shows that many members of the 12 person committee continue to think in terms of end dates, partly because they are worried about the potential costs .The concerns include the potential disruption of financial markets and the delicate balance between encouraging private borrowing and unleashing speculation. Fed officials professed less concern that the purchases could loosen the Fed's grip on inflation . They noted that inflation remained low, and that they expected it to stay under control.\"While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased,\" the meeting account said.The stock market declined after the Fed released the account of its deliberations, suggesting some investors were surprised by the cautious tone, but the drop was modest. The Standard Poor's 500 stock index lost.21 percent of its value at the close of trading.Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said investors had expected the Fed to keep buying \"through much, if not all, of this year.\" He said investors would now need to watch more closely for evidence that the recovery was gaining strength, which could lead the Fed to curtail its purchases.\"This should significantly amplify the financial market's sensitivity to upcoming economic data,\" Mr. LaVorgna wrote in a note to clients Thursday.The government will release its monthly jobs report Friday morning .But Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said investors should keep the account in perspective, as a reflection of modest misgivings in the middle of the most aggressive effort the Fed has ever undertaken to stimulate the economy .The central bank announced after the December meeting that it planned to hold short term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below.5 percent, provided inflation remained under control, and it estimated that the rate would cross that threshold no sooner than mid.The Fed also plans to maintain for the foreseeable future the vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities it has acquired since 2008 to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers .And Ms. Swonk said she saw nothing in the account to alter her conviction that the Fed intended to keep adding to that stockpile through the coming year. She said the reservations of some officials had not prevented the new campaign, and would not force an early conclusion, because the basic argument for the purchases remained compelling the economy is not growing fast enough, too many people remain unemployed, and the rest of government is not helping.\"I think that they would love to be able to stop,\" Ms. Swonk said, but given the condition of the economy, \"I think there's still a huge bias toward buying.\"She said that four of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee would be replaced in January, and that two new arrivals Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had been outspoken supporters of asset purchases . The Fed's current program of asset purchases began in September with the announcement that it would buy 40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until the outlook for the labor market \"improved substantially.\"In December, the Fed said it would also expand its holdings of Treasuries by 45 billion each month, replacing a program in which it acquired that amount of long term Treasuries each month by selling the same amount of short term Treasuries, so that the total size of its portfolio remained unchanged .The account said that a few officials predicted the purchases would need to continue through the end of the year, and a few said it was too soon to make a judgment.\"Several others thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before the end of, citing concerns about financial stability or the size of the balance sheet,\" the account continued, before concluding, \"One member viewed any additional purchases as unwarranted.\""}

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell,000 to a seasonally adjusted,000, the Department of Labor said.\"Underlying labor market conditions probably are not as bad as the recent claims data suggest,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase .Economists, who had expected first time applications to fall to,000 in the week ending Oct. 19, said claims should return to levels consistent with a gradual labor market recovery once the California backlog is cleared.In a separate report, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index on manufacturing fell to.1, the lowest since October, from.8 in September. A reading below 50 indicates contraction .While Markit suggested that the slowdown in factory activity was a result of the 16 day government shutdown, economists were skeptical. \"I don't think all the businesses tightened their reins during the shutdown,\" said Jacob Oubina, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets .Initial jobless claims have been trending lower, suggesting employers are no longer laying off workers at an aggressive pace.

{"_id": 16, "text": "LONDON The mining giant Glencore Xstrata reported sharply lower results on Tuesday after it wrote down.7 billion on the value of assets it acquired as part of the merger that created the company . BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, also reported a drop in profit because of a decline in commodity prices as a result of weaker worldwide demand . Glencore Xstrata, whose merger this year combined a mining company, Xstrata, with a commodity trading house, Glencore International, said the write down was a result of \"residual good will\" from the acquisition of Xstrata that \"could not be supported.\"The company said it was \"reflecting the broader negative mining industry environment\" and the greater risk associated with larger expansion projects. Glencore Xstrata also wrote down 452 million against the value of its nickel operations in Australia, citing the challenging market, and 324 million against the value of its stake in the Russian aluminum producer Rusal because of an accounting standards requirement, bringing the total write down in the period to.47 billion. Profit in the first half of the year at Glencore Xstrata, based in Baar, Switzerland, fell 39 percent, to.04 billion, from.36 billion in the period a year earlier.Paul Gait, a mining analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, noted that even though the write down was \"pretty large,\" Glencore Xstrata was right to take it in one stroke.\"It allows the new management to start with a clean slate,\" Mr. Gait said. \"There's a huge incentive to take all the medicine up front.\"Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive of Glencore Xstrata, said the company would \"remain focused on the disciplined allocation of capital as well as robustly scrutinizing all pre existing capital plans of the enlarged entity.\"The first half results were the first set of figures the company reported after the merger, which followed a yearlong battle that required Glencore to raise its offer for Xstrata after a shareholder revolt over the price. The combined company agreed to buy Viterra, Canada's largest grain handling firm, for.2 billion to expand its presence in agriculture .To reduce costs, Glencore Xstrata has been reviewing its portfolio and has started to sell some projects. It agreed to sell Joe White Maltings, a maker of malt, a form of barley used in brewing beer and other alcoholic drinks, to Cargill this month, and its Las Bambas copper mine in Peru has been put up for sale.Shares in Glencore Xstrata fell.2 percent in early trading on Tuesday in London.At BHP, based in Melbourne, Australia, profit for the year ended June 30 fell 30 percent, to.9 billion, from a year earlier.Uncertainty about the speed of the economic recovery and weakening demand for commodities pressured many mining companies to focus on reducing costs and holding back on investments.Many companies in the sector are struggling with relatively high fixed costs after making large investments when metals prices were high between 2009 and. They are also seeking to win back investor trust, which suffered when some shareholders criticized relatively large executive pay and meager shareholder payouts.Despite plans to reduce costs, BHP said on Tuesday that it would invest.6 billion in its Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan province in Canada, one of the world's biggest potash producing regions. BHP said it might be looking for partners for the potash venture.BHP, under its new chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, has continued to focus on improving efficiency, a drive that started about a year ago. The company said on Tuesday that it expected overcapacity in aluminum and nickel to continue in the medium term, but that urbanization and demographics should create long term demand for commodities in Asia and other markets ."}
{"_id": 16, "text": "PARIS The scene at Charles de Gaulle Airport on Tuesday underscored an all too familiar trope about France.With air traffic controllers on strike, tourists from around the world arrived in Paris to find themselves stranded, many unable to make connecting flights to other parts of the Continent. The three day strike, which began Tuesday, sought to protest a proposal to accelerate the integration of air traffic management systems across the Continent. But for some it mainly served to highlight France's stubborn singularity, which has made the country increasingly uncompetitive in European and global marketplaces .\"These strikes always happen, especially during the months of June and July,\" said Britt Marie Stromer, a 70 year old Swedish retiree . \"It doesn't work like this in other European countries .\"Some,800 flights roughly half of all scheduled flights were canceled across the country Tuesday, while hundreds more were delayed and disrupted by the spillover in Europe. French aviation officials said they expected as many as 50 percent of flights to be canceled again Wednesday until at least midday Thursday. The controllers are protesting Brussels's plans to accelerate the integration of the European Union's fragmented air space, meant to improve transportation efficiency and lower the cost of air travel .The terminals at Paris area airports were largely calm, because most airlines had managed to warn passengers well in advance. But many travelers still had not gotten the word.But many passengers said they could not comprehend why France, one of Europe's biggest tourist destinations, appeared so resistant to changes that economists say have the potential to bolster travel and, with it, economic growth .\"I'm on vacation, which is supposed to be a relaxing time,\" said Brittany Beaton, a 28 year old social worker from Canada who had planned to fly to Barcelona . An alternative flight Air France offered her was too expensive, she said, \"so I'm going to try to take a train.\"French airports, airlines and traffic controllers tend to have the reputation of being more strike prone than their European peers . In reality, analysts say, a number of similarly disruptive labor actions have been undertaken in recent years by workers in Germany, Spain and Britain.Nonetheless, Tuesday's events seemed to follow mounting opposition by workers in other sectors of the French economy who continue to resist structural changes aimed at shaving labor and operating costs .While it was hard to tell on Tuesday, the government of France's Socialist president, Fran ois Hollande, says it actually strongly supports the idea of a unified regional airspace. But French officials do not like the way Brussels is trying to cajole its 27 member states toward that goal.Since the fall, Siim Kallas, the European transport commissioner, has been trying to turn up the heat on member states like France that are seen to be dragging their feet. It was a decade ago that European officials proposed legislation to replace a crazy quilt of air traffic control fiefs that officials say account for about.5 billion in unnecessary costs each year. The measure was passed by the European Parliament in 2009 and subsequently endorsed by France and all other member states .Last year, Mr. Kallas threatened legal action and fines against member states for not meeting key milestones of the legislation. On Tuesday, he proposed ways to to inject fresh momentum into the process by granting significant new decision making powers to Eurocontrol, an agency in Brussels that is already responsible for coordinating air traffic flows across the Union and an additional 12 nearby countries .His proposals include a measure to separate national regulation of air travel from traffic management services, as well as a mandate that state owned monopoly providers of navigation, weather forecasting, surveillance and other services be privatized. But Mr. Kallas's proposals require approval from the European Parliament and member states .It is these proposals that have angered Paris. In an interview Tuesday, France's transport minister, Fr d ric Cuvillier, said the initiative amounted to \"regulatory harassment.\" He accused Brussels of trying to rush through one size fits all changes that did not take into account differences in the way member states have historically managed their own airspace.\"It is necessary that these things happen in a spirit of respect for differences in national organization,\" Mr. Cuvillier said. \"We have to give it time.\"And just to show France was not alone, Mr. Cuvillier said he had persuaded his German counterpart, Peter Ramsauer, to sign a joint letter to Mr. Kallas, asking him to delay presenting his new proposals to the European Parliament .But Mr. Kallas said France, Germany and others have already had plenty of time.\"Our airlines and their passengers have had to endure more than 10 years of reduced services and missed deadlines,\" he said Tuesday in Strasbourg. \"We need to boost the competitiveness of the European aviation sector and create more jobs in the airlines and at airports.\"For passengers like Alexander Eliassem, a 38 year old Norwegian, patience with France's philosophy was wearing thin on Tuesday. He and his exhausted family were off to search for a place to stay for the night after their Lufthansa flight to Oslo was canceled.\"I have a 9 year old child with me so, yes, it's a little difficult,\" Mr. Eliassem said. He said the airline would partly reimburse him, but only if he stayed in a hotel of no more than three stars in the notoriously generous rating system. \"This is France, so that isn't saying much.\""}
{"_id": 16, "text": "LONDON Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's largest oil company, surprised markets on Tuesday by naming Ben van Beurden to succeed Peter Voser as chief executive on Jan. 1.Mr. van Beurden, 55, a Dutch citizen, has headed Shell's large marketing and refining business since January and has been an important player in its liquefied natural gas business, in which Shell is the world leader among publicly traded oil companies .He was chosen by Shell's board over better known candidates including Andrew Brown, head of exploration and production Marvin Odum, head of the company's Americas business and Simon Henry, the chief financial officer, who is well known to investors .\"This will be something of a surprise to analysts who widely expected \" Mr. Henry to be chosen, said Peter Hutton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. \"However, it was always clear that Shell would appoint the person it felt had the best combination of skills for the job, not necessarily the best known to the external community.\"Mr. Voser had said in May that he would step down next year after less than five years in the top job, news that surprised the markets .He said he wanted to spend more time with his family, which had remained in his native Switzerland while he worked at Shell headquarters in London.Previously chief financial officer, Mr. Voser had helped stabilize Shell after a scandal over misstatement of oil and gas reserves . While uncomfortable in the limelight, he is thought to have improved the carrying out of big projects like the 20 billion Pearl gas to liquids plant in Qatar that have come to distinguish Shell.The standard spot for prospective chief executives at major oil companies is the exploration and production division, which is usually the big profit earner.Shell differs from other major oil companies like BP by stressing big long term projects that lack the tremendous potential financial rewards of oil exploration but produce steady returns with lower risk . Liquefied natural gas tends to earn returns in the relatively modest 10 to 15 percent range, analysts say, but it produces steady cash flows for decades with little additional capital expenditure .Shell has invested around 40 billion in the business in recent years . It hopes to cash in on growing use of gas in China and other developing countries .It is also one of the few companies that is investing large sums in gas to liquids plants, the monster installations required to transform natural gas into fuels like diesel. And it is the leader in the still unproved technology of building gigantic floating vessels to process liquefied natural gas in remote locations.In an industry where access to oil and gas is increasingly competitive, Shell hopes a demonstrated ability to design and manage megaprojects will give it a competitive advantage.Mr. van Beurden's experience appears tailored to Shell's strategy. For instance, he has 10 years in Shell's liquefied natural gas business . That business, along with gas to liquids, earned Shell.4 billion of its.1 billion in profit last year.\"Ben will continue to drive and further develop the strategic agenda that we have set out, to generate competitive returns for our shareholders,\" Shell's chairman, Jorma Ollila, said in a statement Tuesday."}
{"_id": 16, "text": "LONDON Vodafone on Tuesday posted its first decline in full year revenue since, saying that rapid growth at its American unit and in emerging markets did not make up for a slump in Southern Europe and price cuts mandated by European regulators . Revenue at Vodafone was down.2 percent to.4 billion, or.6 billion, for, while core earnings fell.1 percent to.3 billion.The company, based in London, said it would keep a.1 billion dividend payment from its American unit, Verizon Wireless, rather than returning it to shareholders. Vodafone is at the center of intense speculation as to whether it will sell its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, in a deal that has been estimated at 120 billion.''We have faced headwinds from a combination of continued tough economic conditions, particularly in Southern Europe and an adverse European regulatory environment,'' Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, said in a statement.Mr. Colao declined to comment on whether he would consider a sale of the Verizon Wireless stake, merely saying that he had nothing new to report. Verizon Communications, the American company that holds the other 55 percent of Verizon Wireless, has made little secret of its wish to buy out its British partner. It has ramped up the pressure in recent months, saying that it believed it could buy the asset in a tax efficient way.The full year results highlighted a problem for Mr. Colao, with Verizon Wireless growing at a rapid rate compared with assets in the core European markets that have now struggled for several years.The steepest revenue declines came from Southern Europe, where operators are cutting prices to win business from struggling consumers . In Italy, service revenue fell .8 percent, while in Spain it was down.5 percent.The group also took a.8 billion charge on its business in Italy, bringing the total write downs for Spain and Italy for the year to.7 billion.Having completed a three year dividend program that guaranteed 7 percent growth per year, Vodafone said it now aimed at least to maintain the ordinary dividend per share at current levels .Full year margins on core earnings were down.5 percentage points to.9 percent, from.1 percent just three years ago .''The situation in Southern Europe remains one of disappointment,'' said Richard Hunter, the head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. ''The question of the Verizon stake remains at the top of the agenda for investors, although Vodafone's decision hitherto to stay put continues to reap measurable rewards, quite apart from the value of its stake appreciating by the year.''"}
{"_id": 16, "text": "FRANKFURT The German engineering and electronics giant Siemens said on Thursday that its profit fell 10 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 as sales dipped and the company booked restructuring costs .But the chief executive of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, promised a 15 percent increase in per share earnings during the coming 12 months, driven in part by a planned share buyback .Siemens said that net profit for its final fiscal quarter fell to.1 billion euros, or roughly.5 billion, from.2 billion a year earlier. Sales fell 1 percent to.2 billion, in part because of a sharp decline in the United States, where the company had trouble completing projects on time for customers in the metals industry.The earnings come after a difficult year for one of Germany's signature companies, which is often seen as a bellwether for the nation's industrial sector . Mr. Kaeser was named chief executive in July after his predecessor, Peter L scher, resigned under pressure as he faced problems such as losses in the solar power business and difficulty connecting a new offshore wind park in the North Sea to the electrical grid .During a news conference in Berlin, Mr. Kaeser, who previously was the company's chief financial officer, conceded that management had made mistakes. \"We can and will be much better,\" he said.Siemens said it would buy back as much as 4 billion worth of its own shares. The reduction in the total number of shares, along with a rebound in profit from operations, will increase earnings per share by 15 percent compared to the.08 that Siemens reported in the 2013 fiscal year, the company said.Siemens shares rose .7 percent to close at.92 in trading in Frankfurt.Though it has tried to focus on fewer business lines, including spinning off its lighting division earlier this year, Siemens remains active in an array of industries. The company's products include trains and streetcars, medical scanners and equipment for power transmission and generation. Siemens also helps companies build and equip factories .A cost cutting program known as Siemens 2014 subtracted 688 million from operating profit, the company said.New orders, an indicator of future sales, fell 1 percent during the quarter to 21 billion. But in contrast to sales, new orders rose in the United States and in most other regions except Europe, where economic growth remains anemic.During the news conference, Mr. Kaeser offered unusually sharp criticism of plans by the German government under Chancellor Angela Merkel to shift the country to renewable energy in coming decades and to close nuclear power plants .Although the German government is a major customer for trains and other Siemens products, Mr. Kaeser said the energy plan was poorly thought through. German energy costs are four times as high as in the United States, he said.\" German companies aren't operating isolated in a domestic market,\" Mr. Kaeser said. \"They are competing against the best in the world.\" Siemens' main rival worldwide is probably General Electric, which has often been more profitable. Renewable energy has been a major area of growth for Siemens, despite problems in the division that made equipment for solar energy and was sold. Profit from a division that makes wind turbines rose 34 percent to 179 million during the quarter, Siemens said. However, the company's power transmission unit suffered a loss of 42 million ."}
{"_id": 16, "text": "HONG KONG It was perhaps the most spectacular flight approach in the world amid mountains, seas and frequently tempestuous winds, aircraft nearing Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong would stage a stomach churning right turn, glide over the densely populated Kowloon Peninsula and land on a runway that jutted straight out into the sea.Starting Wednesday, passengers approaching the old runway will do so at crawl speed and from the sea, rather than from the air. After 15 years of lying idle, the former airport will reopen its gates to the world's travelers as a cruise ship terminal at the southern end of the old runway.Gleaming silver, and 850 meters, or about half mile long, the new terminal building has airy immigration and check in halls reminiscent of, yes, an airport. A large, manicured rooftop garden with 360 degree views of the Hong Kong skyline will open to the public in the next few months. And the terminal's two berths will be able to accommodate the largest cruise ships in the world behemoths more than 300 meters long that can carry thousands of passengers.The first of those giants the 15 deck, 310 meter Mariner of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean International and carrying more than,000 passengers is scheduled to dock at the terminal Wednesday evening .The new terminal cost.2 billion in Hong Kong dollars, or about 1 billion, and was designed by the architectural firm of Norman Foster, whose other designs include plans for the renovation of the New York Public Library . Mr. Foster's firm also designed the larger airport that replaced Kai Tak in July.For now, most of the old airport, including the area where the terminal building once stood, lies empty, the shiny new cruise terminal awkwardly isolated at the far end of the former runway. The nearest neighborhoods Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay are somewhat rundown, and until planned public transportation connections are completed in the coming years, the terminal building's rooftop gardens will be tough for ordinary visitors to reach.While Hong Kong is home to one of the busiest container ports in the world, cruise companies held off factoring the terminal into their itineraries until it was actually finished. Just 19 ships are scheduled to dock at the new terminal in the next 12 months.Still, industry executives say they believe that traffic will gradually increase as cruise activity in Asia picks up, and Hong Kong policy makers see the project as crucial to expanding tourism in the city.Gregory So, the Hong Kong secretary for commerce and economic development, said at a media briefing last week that the new terminal would \"greatly enhance the berthing capacity for cruise ships in Hong Kong, thereby enhancing our competitiveness and attractiveness.\"The decision to convert the old airport site is, in essence, a bet on Asia's growing appetite for travel.Over the last few decades, thanks to rising affluence and improved transport links, Asia has evolved from being primarily a destination for wealthy Westerners to being an increasingly important source of new travelers Asians journeying to places within the region and beyond. Travel from mainland China, in particular, has soared, making the country both the biggest source of foreign tourists in the world, and the biggest spender in global tourism, according to the World Tourism Organization.This growth has yet to extend into the cruise ship segment, which remains overwhelmingly focused on travel within the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. Just under two thirds of the roughly 21 million people in the world who will take a cruise this year will come from North America, and about 27 percent will come from Europe, according to Cruise Market Watch, an American firm that compiles data on the industry. Only about 7 percent come from Asia .In part, that is because Asians have only recently begun to approach travel as something that involves relaxation and leisure, rather than an activity focused on shopping and sightseeing, said Liu Zinan, chairman of the Asia Cruise Association and vice president of Asia for Royal Caribbean .The lack of terminals that accommodate cruise ships also has hampered growth in the region.\"Compared to the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, there is a paucity of destinations for cruise ships to go,\" said Jeff Bent, managing director of Worldwide Cruise Terminals, which manages the new terminal in Hong Kong . \" Cruise lines have fewer options to put together interesting itineraries.\"That is changing rapidly as port cities and cruise companies race to expand their capacities in the region.\"The market potential for cruising in Asia is huge as the total potential number of cruise passengers could reach.7 million by, and double to over seven million by,\" said Pier Luigi Foschi, the Asia head of Carnival Cruise Lines, which opened an office in Singapore last month to spearhead its operations in the region.Singapore opened a large new cruise ship terminal last year, which, like the new center in Hong Kong, can handle ships as large as,000 tons . The terminal expects 100 ship calls in the coming cruise season, which runs from October to May.In Hong Kong, the debut of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal opens the city to superlarge cruise liners, which are too large to dock at the existing Ocean Terminal, just across Victoria Harbor from the city's skyscraper studded financial district .And in mainland China, new operations have been developed in several coastal cities .\" Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, Singapore they are all racing with each other to become leading cruise ports in the region,\" said Mr. Liu of Royal Caribbean . Hong Kong's geographic location and hotel and transport infrastructures, he added, mean the new terminal will be an important feature on tour operators' itineraries.Anyone who might want to reminisce over the old Kai Tak Airport and its legendary flight approach, however, will have to look elsewhere. The new building retains little of the site's former incarnation, though a park being planned alongside it will have an \"aviation theme.\""}
{"_id": 16, "text": "PARIS Would it make sense for one troubled carmaker with huge losses and acres of idle factory space to acquire another troubled carmaker with the same problem?It would not, investors seemed to have decided Friday, as a rally in the shares of the French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citro n fizzled along with speculation about a stronger alliance with General Motors and its Opel unit.According to such speculation, based on a report Thursday by Reuters, the Peugeot family was ready to cede control of the ailing French carmaker that bears its name. The family, which holds a.2 percent stake and about 38 percent of the voting rights in Peugeot, was prepared to give up control y if General Motors raised its stake from the 7 percent it already owned, Reuters reported .Peugeot shares rose as much as.5 percent in Paris trading on Thursday based on the report, which also said that the Peugeot family had held talks with Dongfeng, a Chinese automaker. But Peugeot shares retreated on Friday after analysts said neither option was plausible. The shares were down about 3 percent Friday afternoon .Neither Peugeot nor Opel, which uses the Vauxhall brand name in Britain, is selling enough cars to keep their factories busy. The plants, which cost money even when they are not being used, have contributed to large losses at both companies . In addition, Opel and Peugeot have suffered declining market share and are focused on the depressed European market, without enough sales in healthier regions like China to compensate.\"The business rationale doesn't stack up,\" said Paul Newton, an analyst at IHS Automotive, a market research firm . \"They compete in all the same segments in the same markets .\"In both France, where Peugeot has most of its factories, and Germany, Opel's home base, closing plants and laying off workers is extremely difficult because of labor laws as well as stubborn resistance from unions and political leaders .\"You'd really have to get to work and cut a lot of capacity,\" Mr. Newton said. \"It would be ugly really. I don't know why they would want to do it.\"\"There is no urgency about a capital increase,'' a person close to the Peugeot family said, dismissing the reports of a G.M. or Chinese deal as \"rumors.\" The person, who asked not to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the automaker \"is always talking with its American and Chinese partners\" as part of its normal business .\"But,\" the person said, \"the Peugeot family is very attached to its history and its stake in the firm .\" General Motors, which reported a loss of 200 million in Europe for the first quarter of this year, said it had no interest in raising its investment.\"Our position remains unchanged we have no intention of investing additional funds into PSA at this time,\" G.M. said in a statement. \"We will not comment on speculation.\"But the fact that such talk was taken seriously underscores the perilous situation Peugeot is facing in a European market that continues to shrink five years after the financial crisis hit.Peugeot, which reported a.5 percent decline in sales in the first quarter after a loss of.5 billion euros in, is not big enough to finance new products as well as its competitors can or enjoy the same volume discounts on parts.The automaker also suffers from its dependence on the dismal European market . Car sales on the Continent fell in May to their lowest level in 20 years, and analysts say there is little hope for a turnaround in the foreseeable future.In Europe, the French company trails only Volkswagen in unit sales. But a vast gulf separates the two companies globally, thanks largely to Volkswagen's international footprint, including in China, which has become the German carmaker's largest market .Peugeot also continues to be outperformed by Renault, its smaller French rival, largely because of Renault's global alliance with Nissan Motor. The alliance gives Renault international reach that Peugeot, despite big gains this year in China and Latin America, cannot match."}
{"_id": 16, "text": "TSURU, Japan As the world's fastest train raced through central Japan, former Gov . George E. Pataki of New York hoisted his 6 foot 5 frame into the aisle and marveled at the smoothness of the ride.\"In the subway I'd need a strap, at least,\" Mr. Pataki said as the speedometer hit 315 miles an hour . He hunched over to catch a fleeting glimpse of Mount Fuji through the portholelike windows. \"This is amazing. The future.\"The future for Japan, perhaps. For the United States, the future is less clear. Mr. Pataki and other former American politicians were in Japan Saturday for a special test ride of the train, which uses a technology called magnetic levitation, or maglev. They are trying to bring a maglev train to the crowded Northeast Corridor that will cruise between New York and Washington at more than twice the 150 mile an hour top speed of Amtrak's Acela, the fastest train in the United States .Maglev trains could make the journey in an hour, compared with just under three hours, on a good day, for Acela. That would be considerably faster than flying, especially when getting to and from the airport is factored in. Yet this is only the latest in a series of high speed train proposals for the Northeast Corridor, none of which has been undertaken since Acela, which began service in.To interest lawmakers and investors in the United States in the Japanese technology, Japan has offered to cover several billion dollars in costs . The commitment of Japanese taxpayer money is a sign of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's determination to do whatever it takes to prime the Japanese economy and to restore Japan's fading reputation for technological prowess.Japan's maglev could easily become Mr. Abe's boondoggle unless Japan can export it. Even in Japan, the maglev faces considerable skepticism. One reason is the cost, which is as breathtaking as the speed the estimated budget for the Tokyo Osaka line has risen to nearly 100 billion.So Mr. Abe is looking for a prominent overseas showcase. That is why the former politicians were here.Mr. Pataki, along with the other dignitaries on the train, including Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader former Gov . Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and former Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, are helping him make the sale. Along with former Gov . Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who could not make the trip, they are on the advisory board of The Northeast Maglev, a company in Washington that wants to build the Washington New York line. Japan has long been a pioneer in high speed rail . It introduced bullet trains, or Shinkansen, to the world in, on the eve of the Tokyo Olympics . But other countries have caught up. France and Germany developed high speed trains that matched the Japanese speeds. China has built a high speed network that surpasses Japan's in its reach if not quite its speed.To stake its claim to leadership in a new generation of faster technology, Japan plans to begin construction of its first intercity maglev line next year, linking Tokyo with Nagoya and, eventually, Osaka. In tests, the Japanese maglev has reached speeds up to 580 kilometers an hour, or 360 m.p.h., the world record for a train.\"It is truly a dream technology,\" Mr. Abe said in a speech at the New York Stock Exchange in September.When it comes to maglev, though, there is still a question of credibility. \"Americans think levitation only occurs in horror movies,\" Mr. Rendell said.With the Japanese maglev, levitation occurs at about 90 m.p.h. That is when the wheels, shod with rubber tires, lift off the concrete guideway. Then the maglev train floats four inches above the U shaped guideway, held aloft and propelled forward by superconducting magnets.To get the American line off the ground, Japan has come up with a method of financing that is similarly novel. In a meeting with President Obama last winter, Mr. Abe offered to provide the maglev guideway and propulsion system free for the first portion of the line, linking Washington and Baltimore via Baltimore Washington International Airport, a distance of about 40 miles.Analysts say Japan has had trouble exporting the technology. It figures if the United States takes it, others will follow.The Northeast Maglev, the company behind the effort, wants to raise the rest of the money from private investors and public sources. The company was founded in 2010 but only recently began ramping up its lobbying in Washington, with Mr. Daschle, now a policy adviser to the law firm DLA Piper, serving as a central figure in those efforts.The Northeast Maglev's chief executive is Wayne L. Rogers, an investor in renewable energy and other projects. Japanese financing would be provided by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which arranges support for Japanese exports .It's not just the cost that makes Japanese skeptical of the maglev plans. The maglev line, to be built by the Central Japan Railway Company, would pass straight through some of the most mountainous terrain in the country, including the Japanese Alps. About 86 percent of the route is to run through tunnels, creating monumental engineering challenges and raising concerns about the effects of earthquakes.The Tokyo Nagoya portion is not expected to be completed until, with the Nagoya Osaka stretch to follow only in. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research expects that by that time, the population of Japan will have declined to about 105 million from the current 127 million, raising questions of whether there will be enough people to ride a speedy new train.\"If you seriously take a look at its high cost and low demand, you'll find it makes no business sense,\" said Reijiro Hashiyama, a visiting professor at Chiba University of Commerce who has argued against the project for years.Central Japan Railway insists that the new line will stoke demand taking away business from airlines by decreasing journey times and serving new destinations. The company, which was set up when Japan privatized its national rail system in, says it will finance construction through operating cash flow, including the profit generated by its Shinkansen line.\"In the past, the United States led the way in transport technology,\" said Yoshiyuki Kasai, the company's chairman, at the control center of the maglev test track here. \"Now the U.S. transportation infrastructure is in bad shape . This time, why don't the U.S.A. and Japan lead the world together?\""}
{"_id": 16, "text": "BULGA, Australia Bulga, a hamlet nestled in the verdant hills of the wine country north of Sydney, is at the center of a legal dispute that could reshape the regulatory environment of a national economy heavily dependent on natural resource extraction.On Wednesday, a court in the state of New South Wales is set to hear an appeal of a ruling this year that blocked the expansion of a nearby open pit coal mine. The ruling was on a lawsuit brought by Bulga residents against the British Australian mining giant Rio Tinto . The state is joining Rio in the appeal, which is being heard in the highest court in New South Wales .At stake is not just the fate of the village of 300 people. The mining industry and other state governments will be watching the outcome closely as slowing growth in China, the chief consumer of Australian commodities, heightens anxieties over the country's economy .If the appeal succeeds, the mine expansion will proceed as approved by the state last year. If it fails, it could set a precedent that favors the environmental interests of local communities over the economic interests of state governments . That would upend a system that has traditionally given primacy to the interests of large mining companies .\"This is a wake up call,\" Leslie Krey, 66, said in an interview at her house near the Bulga town center.\"There's got to be something other than mines,\" said Ms. Krey, whose husband, John, is one of the leading opponents of expanding the mine.In February, the New South Wales planning authorities approved plans intended to extend the life of the Mount Thorley Warkworth Mine by more than a decade, to. Those plans involved expanding the operation, owned by a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, onto land that Rio Tinto had pledged in 2003 as a permanent conservation zone to shield Bulga from the mine.Bulga residents feared that the noise and dust from an expanded mine would irrevocably damage the environment and reduce home values that were already low. In addition, Saddle Ridge, a spiny natural buffer between the town and the mine, would be demolished. Also, a large section of the critically endangered Warkworth Sands Woodland would face eradication, the residents argued.Many environmental studies were conducted, but no one, not even Rio, is disputing that the expansion would destroy the ridge and the woodland. Rio is asserting that the economic benefit outweighs the environmental impact and is offering to set aside land elsewhere. Graham Witherspoon, a spokesman for Rio, declined to comment on any environmental or financial impact the mine may have on the community.A citizens' group, the Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association, filed a suit to stop the expansion, and in April, the state's Land and Environment Court issued a ruling in the group's favor, citing \"negative social impacts on local community\" and threats to its \"sense of place.\"Now, Rio Tinto has taken the unusual step of asking the New South Wales court to entirely void the ruling, which was handed down by Judge Brian J. Preston. His ruling in April represented the first time the lower Land and Environment Court had ruled against an approved mining grant of this scope and scale, and it had the potential to significantly expand the court's authority .In a 2009 affidavit to the state's Department of Planning, Rio Tinto argued that an expansion would give it access to an additional 163 million tons of coal over the lifetime of the mine. The decision to expand the mine, it said, was based on a sharp increase in the long term average price of coal to 53 per ton in, from 33 per ton when the 2003 grant was approved. The represents more than 8 billion in additional revenue for the company over the life of the mine.Mining, whether for the high quality thermal coal around Bulga the kind used to fuel power plants or the iron and gold in the country's vast open west, is woven deeply into the fabric of rural Australia, where it provides many of the best paying and most stable jobs . It has also been the engine powering a decade of robust economic growth that has largely spared the country from the effects of the global downturn . Rio Tinto says that if the ruling is upheld, production at the mine will begin to slow next year, with the eventual loss of more than,300 jobs across the region, the Hunter Valley."}
{"_id": 16, "text": "MADRID Confident that Spain is emerging from a prolonged recession, the government on Friday presented a budget for 2014 that was largely free of the unpopular austerity measures of recent years.The budget is based on a forecast that the Spanish economy will grow .7 percent next year, up from the government's previous forecast of.5 percent. Gross domestic product is expected to contract.3 percent this year.Calling it a \"budget of economic recovery,\" Crist bal Montoro, the budget minister, forecast that the proposal would \" open the door to job creation in our country\" since it lacked the tax increases and heavy spending cuts of recent years.The government also forecast that the unemployment rate would fall to.9 percent in, down from the record 27 percent that it reached in the first quarter of this year.As part of its belt tightening, the government has extended a salary freeze for civil servants for a fourth consecutive year. And on Friday, it approved changes to the pension system intended to save about 800 million euros .08 billion) next year.Having requested a bailout for its suffering banks in June of last year, the Spanish government has been under pressure to stick to its budgetary commitments, even as it faced frequent street protests against a series of spending cuts and tax increases .Given the depth of Spain's recession, the European Commission agreed last May to give Madrid more time to reach its budgetary targets. The Spanish deficit is expected to fall to.5 percent of gross domestic product this year. That would be down from a revised deficit of.8 percent of G.D.P. last year, which was.2 percentage points less than what Madrid had initially estimated . For, the target is for a deficit of.8 percent of G.D.P.One of the most significant turnarounds for Spain has been the recent fall in its borrowing costs as investors shifted the spotlight to Italy's political fragility and the perceived risk that Italy poses for the euro zone . The interest rate premium demanded by investors for buying Spanish government bonds rather than Germany's benchmark bonds fell this month below that of Italy for the first time since March of last year.Thanks to that improvement, Mr. Montoro said, the cost of financing the country's debt should fall.2 percent next year, to.6 billion euros .While Spain is emerging from a two year recession, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his ministers have recently cautioned that the country still faced a significant economic challenge, with continued weakness in consumer spending and a reluctance by banks to provide credit.The 2014 budget and the proposed changes to the way pension payments are calculated will now need to go to Parliament for a vote, but that is expected to be a formality as Mr. Rajoy's Popular Party holds an absolute majority ."}
{"_id": 17, "text": "It looked to be uniformly bland, which is why scientists chose it as the first rock to be examined up close last year by the Mars rover Curiosity a run of the mill volcanic rock, something to test and calibrate the rover's instruments.The rock turned out to be anything but ordinary, scientists reported last week. It is unlike any Mars rock previously examined and more like an Earth rock.And as for the pile of windblown dust and soil that the rover spent weeks analyzing? It was not dry as dust, but contained water.Such are the surprises that turn out to be a near constant of Mars exploration, according to six new papers on the red planet that appeared last week five in the journal Science and one in The Journal of Geophysical Research Planets.The new findings are \"the nuts and bolts \" of what Curiosity has discovered so far, said John P. Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. On Sept. 19, another paper from the science team reported that Curiosity had not detected any methane, which could have been a sign of present day microbes. The mission is designed to see whether the building blocks of life existed on Mars, especially in the distant past, but includes no experiments to directly detect life.In September last year, Curiosity rolled up to the volcanic rock, a pyramid shaped chunk about the size of a football . The science team named it Jake M after Jacob R. Matijevic, a longtime NASA rover engineer who had died the month before.It appeared to be a chunk of basalt, like many others strewed on the Martian surface.\"Just featureless,\" said Edward M. Stolper, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of one of the Science papers. \"It wasn't expected to be interesting.\"Then the first readings came back. The mix of elements was different from that of other Martian basalts. \"It just didn't look like any of the other guys,\" Dr. Stolper said. \"I could tell that this was an unusual rock type and that it had characteristics that reminded me of certain kinds of terrestrial rocks.\"The rock was alkaline, similar to a well known but uncommon type of rock called mugearite, which is found on volcanic islands like Hawaii . \"People say that less than 1 percent of the rocks on Earth are alkaline,\" Dr. Stolper said. \"If you plopped down on Earth, you wouldn't find something like this likely randomly.\"On Earth, the magma that hardens into alkaline rocks comes from the melting of rocks deep in the mantle in the presence of water. That suggests that the movement of magma and other geological processes within Mars may have been more complex and interesting than has been thought.\"People say, 'Sure, why not?' but we haven't seen it before,\" Dr. Stolper said of the composition of Jake M. \"It's not a little bit different. It's a lot different.\"In October, Curiosity visited the dirt pile a stationary Martian dune piled up by gale force winds,000 to,000 years old and performed the first soil test in its chemistry laboratory, which is packed into a space the size of a microwave oven. The fine dust in the pile, which was named Rocknest, was expected to be a mix of what is blowing around the entire planet.\"It looks pretty similar everywhere we go,\" said Laurie A. Leshin, a professor of earth and environmental science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the lead author of another of the Science papers.When the dirt was scooped into the lab and heated, it released water vapor. Other analysis showed that the dirt and dust consisted of both tiny crystals where the atoms lined up in neat patterns and what the scientists called \"amorphous\" materials the atoms jumbled up randomly, as in glass.There was no evidence of water in the crystallized minerals, so all of the water 2 percent by weight was chemically bound up in the glassy particles.\"It's actually a fair amount,\" Dr. Leshin said. \"We always think of Mars as being this dry desert planet.\"The water in the dust could be a resource for future astronauts. Heating up a cubic foot of dirt would yield a couple of pints of water, Dr. Leshin said.Dr. Grotzinger, the project scientist, said the water could also conceivably be something for hypothetical Martian microbes to drink, although Curiosity has yet to find any of the molecules necessary for carbon based life.Possibly complicating life for human visitors, Curiosity also found that the chemicals called perchlorates, which can cause thyroid problems, are prevalent at the landing site. An earlier NASA mission, Phoenix Mars, had found perchlorates near the north pole .\"It's suggesting perhaps a global distribution of these salts,\" said Daniel P. Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Laboratory and the lead author of the paper that reported the perchlorate findings.The perchlorates also complicate Curiosity's search for the carbon based molecules known as organics that could be the building blocks for life, past or present. Heated in the presence of perchlorates, organic molecules disintegrate into simple carbon dioxide ."}
{"_id": 17, "text": "The former Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, S.D., has a hallowed place in the history of physics as a spot where nothing happens.It was there, in the 1970s, that Raymond Davis Jr. attempted to catch neutrinos, spooky subatomic particles emitted by the sun, in a vat of cleaning fluid a mile underground and for a long time came up empty. For revolutionizing the study of those particles, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in.On Wednesday, an international team of physicists based in the same cavern of the former mine announced a new milestone of frustration, but also hope this time in the search for dark matter, the mysterious, invisible ingredient that astronomers say makes up a quarter of the cosmos.In the first three months of running the biggest, most sensitive dark matter detector yet a vat of 368 kilograms of liquid xenon cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit the researchers said they had not seen a trace of the clouds of particles that theorists say should be wafting through space, the galaxy, the Earth and, of course, ourselves, knocking out at least one controversial class of dark matter candidates .But the experiment has just begun and will run for all of next year. The detector, already twice as sensitive as the next best one, will gain another factor of sensitivity in the coming run.\"Just because we don't see anything in the first run doesn't mean we won't see anything in the second,\" said Richard Gaitskell, a professor of physics at Brown University and a spokesman for an international collaboration that operates the experiment known as LUX, for the Large Underground Xenon dark matter experiment.As has become de rigueur for such occasions, the scientists took pride and hope in how clearly they did not see anything. \"In 25 years of searching, this is the cleanest signal I've ever seen,\" Dr. Gaitskell said in an interview.That meant, the scientists said, that their detector was working so well that they would easily see a dark matter particle if and when it decided to drop by.In this case, they had support from outside scientists. Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at New York University, called the results impressive.\"They have not found dark matter,\" he said. \"There is nothing smacking you in the face to make you think there is something there.\" But as the sensitivity of the detector increases, he added, \"If there is anything in there, it should become apparent.\"The announcement at the Homestake site capped a morning of ceremony, which included Gov . Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota and members of the State Legislature, at what amounted to a coming out party for LUX and for the Sanford Underground Research Facility, a lab being developed in the old mine with a mix of state and private money, as well as support from the Energy Department . The lab is named after the philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, who donated 70 million to get it going.LUX is the latest in a long series of ever larger experiments that have occupied and taunted the world's physicists over the last few years. They are all in abandoned mines or other underground places to shield them from cosmic rays, which could cause false alarms. Daniel McKinsey, an associate professor of physics at Yale and a spokesman for the LUX group, said in an interview that the biggest source of noise in the LUX device was trace radioactivity in the detector itself.Larger instruments are already on the drawing boards of LUX and other collaborations, but physicists say the experiments are already sensitive enough to test some versions of dark matter that have been proposed, including the idea that dark particles interact with ordinary matter by exchanging the recently discovered Higgs boson . Dr. Weiner said he held his breath every time new results from a dark matter experiment were released. Dark matter has teased and tantalized physicists since the 1970s, when it was demonstrated that some invisible material must be providing the gravitational glue to hold galaxies together. Determining what it is would provide insight into particles and forces not described by the Standard Model that now rules physics, not to mention a slew of Nobel Prizes.Physicists' best guess is that this dark matter consists of clouds of exotic subatomic particles left over from the Big Bang and known generically as WIMPs, for weakly interacting massive particles, which would weigh several hundred times as much as a proton but could nevertheless pass through the Earth like smoke through a screen door. They are a generic feature of a much hyped idea known as supersymmetry.Particle physicists have been hoping to produce these particles or other evidence of supersymmetry in the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva or to read their signature in cosmic rays from outer space . No one has ever claimed to have seen such a heavy WIMP, in space or underground, but another experiment in another mine, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, claims to have recorded three events that could have been low mass dark matter particles, only a few times heavier than a proton.The new results from the Homestake mine, if they are correct, would rule out those low mass particles. Dr. Gaitskell explained that if those particles were real, the Homestake detector would have recorded,550 of them.\"If there are,550 of them, boy are we going to see them,\" he said in a presentation at the Homestake facility on Wednesday. \"We do not see the low mass WIMPS.\"But afterward, Juan I. Collar, a dark matter specialist at the University of Chicago who has been urging the community to take low mass WIMPs seriously, questioned whether the LUX detector had been adequately calibrated to detect them.\"They do have a real interest in performing those calibrations, because they would settle the issue,\" Dr. Collar said in an email. \"We just have to be patient. At the end they promised to do so, and I have no doubts they will.\"For now, a quarter of the universe is still missing in action."}
{"_id": 17, "text": "A comet that spent the first.5 billion years of its existence in the farthest reaches of the solar system will almost graze the furnace of the sun on Thursday.Comet ISON's close approach and its possible demise, from the sun's heat and gravitational forces will give scientists an unprecedented look at the ingredients that came together to form the planets.\"It's a dinosaur bone of solar system formation,\" said Carey M. Lisse, a senior research scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, during a NASA news conference on Tuesday.If the comet survives though many experts like Dr. Lisse think it will not it could provide a bright and striking addition to the night sky in early December as it zooms near Earth on its way back out. The best times for viewing would be right before sunrise or right after sunset. Currently it is not readily visible because it is too close to the sun. In recent years, astronomers have spotted many sun grazing comets, but this one is different. Named for the International Scientific Optical Network in Russia, which discovered it in September, it appears to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of debris about a light year from the sun. Most of the earlier sun grazers appear to be pieces from a larger comet that looped around the sun many times.ISON was probably dislodged a few million years ago by the gravitational nudge of a passing star, sending it on a trajectory to the inner solar system for the first time and quite possibly the last.\"And we're going to watch it bake and boil,\" Dr. Lisse said.NASA's fleet of spacecraft, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have been taking pictures as the comet entered the inner solar system. \"This particular comet is of extreme interest to us,\" said James L. Green, the director of planetary science at NASA.Few comets are discovered so far out, and some scientists at first thought ISON was several miles in diameter and would become the \"Comet of the Century,\" rivaling the brightness of a full moon.But as the comet passed Mars, the NASA orbiter took pictures showing that it was three quarters of a mile wide at most, smaller than most comets.Because ISON was discovered so far away, astronomers had plenty of time to plan their observations. Measurements by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which takes infrared photographs, showed a large envelope of carbon dioxide around the nucleus. \"It is looking like carbon dioxide may be a very fundamental molecule in that early solar system rather than carbon monoxide,\" Dr. Lisse said.As ISON approaches the sun, the motions of its tail reveal the usually invisible movements in the solar wind, the torrent of particles continually ejected by the sun. In recent days, the comet has behaved erratically, brightening and dimming that has led to speculation that it has already fallen apart. \"We just don't know if it's in one piece or not,\" said Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory .Even falling apart could be valuable. Dr. Lisse said scientists understood how fine dust particles conglomerated into larger particles the size of BBs and marbles, and they know how comet size objects can combine into planets. But they have not figured out how the BB and marble size objects combine into comets.\"When the BBs and the marbles hit each other, they fall apart,\" Dr. Lisse said. By looking at the process in reverse, he went on, scientists can \"see how it got put together\" in the first place."}
{"_id": 17, "text": "Astronauts traveling to Mars, bombarded by the radiation of outer space, would face modestly higher risks of cancer, new NASA measurements confirm.The findings could lead to a search for better shields to block the radiation, new propulsion technologies to shorten the trip, or a decision by the space agency to recalibrate the allowable risks for such an ambitious interplanetary mission.Radiation on the journey to Mars was measured by NASA's newest Mars rover, Curiosity, which carries an instrument the size of a coffee maker that was originally intended to gauge radiation on the planet's surface. Investigators realized that by turning on the instrument right after the rover's launching in November, they could gather data on the radiation hitting the spacecraft from solar storms and from high energy cosmic rays that come from outside the galaxy.They determined that \"the radiation environment is several hundred times more intense than it is on Earth,\" Cary Zeitlin, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., said during a NASA news conference on Thursday, \"and that's even inside a shielded spacecraft.\" The findings will be published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.Radiation dosage is measured in units known as sieverts. A cumulative dose of one sievert is thought to raise the risk of a fatal cancer by about five percentage points .During Curiosity's 253 day, 350 million mile trip, the rover absorbed about half a sievert an average of.8 thousandths of a sievert per day, mostly from cosmic rays . \"That could be higher under different circumstances,\" Dr. Zeitlin said. The instrument measured radiation from only five solar storms, all modest.NASA is not planning to send people to Mars until the 2030s, but with current technology, it would take six months to get there and six months to return to Earth. As such, astronauts would absorb about two thirds of a sievert. By contrast, a person on Earth receives less than a thousandth of a sievert per year from outer space, Dr. Zeitlin said. Americans absorb a few thousandths of a sievert per year, mostly from X rays and CT scans still much less than from a Mars trip.According to the National Cancer Institute, the lifetime risk of dying from cancer is 21 percent the two thirds of a sievert from a round trip mission to Mars would raise that risk by three percentage points, to 24 percent.The measurements largely agree with earlier estimates and measurements. \"These are confirmatory measurements that will help us refine our models,\" said Edward J. Semones, the spaceflight radiation health officer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston .NASA's standards currently limit the excess cancer risk for its astronauts to three percentage points .\"We currently would exceed our acceptable limits,\" Dr. Semones said.Advocates for a human mission to Mars say the radiation risk is overblown. \"What it shows is that the cosmic ray dose on a Mars mission is not a show stopper,\" Robert Zubrin, founder and president of the Mars Society, said about the new data.\"This is modest proportion of overall risk,\" he added. \"Therefore, what it means is that we don't need to delay a humans to Mars program until we have a miraculous advanced propulsion system that can get us there faster.\"A spacecraft malfunction during the mission would pose a much greater risk to the astronauts than the radiation, Dr. Zubrin said.The radiation risk has also not deterred plans by a private group, the Inspiration Mars Foundation, to launch a married couple on a 501 day flyby of Mars in January.\"Those numbers are less than the risk a lot of people take in sports,\" said Taber MacCallum, the chief technology officer for the foundation. \"They don't seem that unreasonable to me.\"Another private group, Mars One, which hopes to establish a settlement on Mars in the 2020s, said it had already received thousands of applications."}
{"_id": 17, "text": "Two NASA astronauts, working more quickly than expected, completed a spacewalk on Saturday in which they took the first steps to repair a malfunctioning pump module that is part of the cooling system for the International Space Station .The astronauts, Col. Michael S. Hopkins of the Air Force and Richard A. Mastracchio, were far ahead of schedule throughout the nearly five and a half hour spacewalk as they detached tubing and electrical connectors from the pump. They were able to remove the 780 pound module and move it to a temporary storage location, a task that had been scheduled for completion during a second spacewalk.Koichi Wakata, a Japanese astronaut, was operating a robotic arm from inside the station to help with the repairs.Colonel Hopkins and Mr. Mastracchio stepped out of an airlock at 01 a.m. Eastern time, and even though they accomplished more than they had set out to do, they were able to return at 29 p.m., an hour earlier than scheduled. The two encountered few complications.There were also no problems with the spacesuits, which was not the case during a spacewalk in July when a leak in the cooling system caused the helmet of an Italian astronaut to partly fill with water. That spacewalk was called off early as the astronaut, Luca Parmitano, hurried back inside the space station .For Saturday's spacewalk, Colonel Hopkins used the same suit, but critical components had been replaced, and NASA engineers expressed confidence that the problem a clogged filter had been fixed.NASA had also developed two low tech workarounds in case there was a repeat of the earlier problem. The astronauts had absorbent pads installed in the back of their helmets and during the spacewalk tilted their heads to check if the pads were \"squishy.\" Neither astronaut reported any signs of moisture in their helmets.The astronauts also had improvised snorkels made out of plastic tubing and Velcro, extending from their helmets down into the chest area of the spacesuit. If water encroached, the tube would allow them to breathe air from the lower part of the suit.Saturday's spacewalk was required after a valve controlling one of two loops of circulating ammonia that cool equipment on the space station malfunctioned on Dec. 11. When efforts to control the ammonia flow using a different valve proved inadequate, space station managers decided to send the astronauts out to make repairs.The work is scheduled to continue on Tuesday."}
{"_id": 18, "text": "HELENA, Mont. On a warm morning not long ago on the shore of a small prairie lake outside this state capital, Bob Martinka trained his spotting scope on a towering cottonwood tree heavy with blue heron nests. He counted a dozen of the tall, graceful birds and got out his smartphone, not to make a call but to type the number of birds and the species into an app that sent the information to researchers in New York.Mr. Martinka, a retired state wildlife biologist and an avid bird watcher, is part of the global ornithological network eBird. Several times a week he heads into the mountains to scan lakes, grasslands, even the local dump, and then reports his sightings to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a nonprofit organization based at Cornell University .\"I see rare gulls at the dump quite frequently,\" Mr. Martinka said, scanning a giant mound of bird covered trash. Tens of thousands of birders are now what the lab calls \"biological sensors,\" turning their sightings into digital data by reporting where, when and how many of which species they see. Mr. Martinka's sighting of a dozen herons is a tiny bit of information, but such bits, gathered in the millions, provide scientists with a very big picture perhaps the first crowdsourced, real time view of bird populations around the world.Birds are notoriously hard to count. While stationary sensors can measure things like carbon dioxide levels and highway traffic, it takes people to note the type and number of birds in an area. Until the advent of eBird, which began collecting daily global data in, so called one day counts were the only method.While counts like the Audubon Christmas Bird Count and the Breeding Bird Survey bring a lot of people together on one day to make bird observations across the country, and are scientifically valuable, they are different because they don't provide year round data.And eBird's daily view of bird movements has yielded a vast increase in data and a revelation for scientists. The most informative product is what scientists call a heat map a striking image of the bird sightings represented in various shades of orange according to their density, moving through space and time across black maps. Now, more than 300 species have a heat map of their own.\"As soon as the heat maps began to come out, everybody recognized this is a game changer in how we look at animal populations and their movement,\" said John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab. \"Really captivating imagery teaches us more effectively.\"It was long believed, for example, that the United States had just one population of orchard orioles . Heat maps showed that the sightings were separated by a gap, meaning there are not one but two genetically distinct populations.Moreover, the network offers a powerful way to capture data that was lost in the old days. \"People for generations have been accumulating an enormous amount of information about where birds are and have been,\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"Then it got burned when they died.\"No longer eBird has compiled 141 million reports, or bits, and the number is increasing by 40 percent a year. In May, eBird gathered a record.6 million new observations from 169 countries . (Mr. Martinka's sighting of 12 herons at once, for example, is considered one species observation, or bit.)The system also offers incentives for birders to stay involved, with apps that enable them to keep their life lists (records of the species they have seen, compare their sightings with those of friends (and rivals, and know where to look for birds they haven't seen before.\"When you get off the plane and turn your phone on,\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said, \"you can find out what has been seen near you over the last seven days and ask it to filter out the birds you haven't seen yet, so with a quick look you can add to your life list.\"The system is not without problems. Citizen scientists may not be as precise in reporting data as experienced researchers are, like the ones in the Breeding Bird Survey. Cornell has tried to solve that problem by hiring top birders to travel around the world to train people like Mr. Martinka in methodology. And 500 volunteer experts read the submissions for accuracy, rejecting about 2 percent. Rare bird sightings get special scrutiny."}
{"_id": 18, "text": "As unlikely as this may sound, we have lucked out in recent years when it comes to global warming .The rise in the surface temperature of earth has been markedly slower over the last 15 years than in the 20 years before that. And that lull in warming has occurred even as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the atmosphere at a record pace.The slowdown is a bit of a mystery to climate scientists . True, the basic theory that predicts a warming of the planet in response to human emissions does not suggest that warming should be smooth and continuous. To the contrary, in a climate system still dominated by natural variability, there is every reason to think the warming will proceed in fits and starts .But given how much is riding on the scientific forecast, the practitioners of climate science would like to understand exactly what is going on. They admit that they do not, even though some potential mechanisms of the slowdown have been suggested. The situation highlights important gaps in our knowledge of the climate system, some of which cannot be closed until we get better measurements from high in space and from deep in the ocean.As you might imagine, those dismissive of climate change concerns have made much of this warming plateau. They typically argue that \" global warming stopped 15 years ago \" or some similar statement, and then assert that this disproves the whole notion that greenhouse gases are causing warming.Rarely do they mention that most of the warmest years in the historical record have occurred recently. Moreover, their claim depends on careful selection of the starting and ending points. The starting point is almost always, a particularly warm year because of a strong El Ni o weather pattern.Somebody who wanted to sell you gold coins as an investment could make the same kind of argument about the futility of putting your retirement funds into the stock market . If he picked the start date and the end date carefully enough, the gold salesman could make it look like the stock market did not go up for a decade or longer.But that does not really tell you what your retirement money is going to do in the market over 30 or 40 years. It does not even tell you how you would have done over the cherry picked decade, which would have depended on exactly when you got in and out of the market .Scientists and statisticians reject this sort of selective use of numbers, and when they calculate the long term temperature trends for the earth, they conclude that it continues to warm through time. Despite the recent lull, it is an open question whether the pace of that warming has undergone any lasting shift.What to make of it all?We certainly cannot conclude, as some people want to, that carbon dioxide is not actually a greenhouse gas . More than a century of research thoroughly disproves that claim.In fact, scientists can calculate how much extra heat should be accumulating from the human caused increases in greenhouse gases, and the energies involved are staggering. By a conservative estimate, current concentrations are trapping an extra amount of energy equivalent to,000 Hiroshima bombs exploding across the face of the earth every day.So the real question is where all that heat is going, if not to warm the surface. And a prime suspect is the deep ocean. Our measurements there are not good enough to confirm it absolutely, but a growing body of research suggests this may be an important part of the answer.Exactly why the ocean would have started to draw down extra heat in recent years is a mystery, and one we badly need to understand. But the main ideas have to do with possible shifts in winds and currents that are causing surface heat to be pulled down faster than before.The deep ocean theory is one of a half dozen explanations that have been proffered for the warming plateau. Perhaps the answer will turn out to be some mix of all of them. And in any event, computer forecasts of climate change suggest that pauses in warming lasting a couple of decades should not surprise us.Now, here is a crucial piece of background It turns out we had an earlier plateau in global warming, from roughly the 1950s to the 1970s, and scientists do not fully understand that one either. A lot of evidence suggests that sunlight blocking pollution from dirty factories may have played a role, as did natural variability in ocean circulation. The pollution was ultimately reduced by stronger clean air laws in the West .Today, factory pollution from China and other developing countries could be playing a similar role in blocking some sunlight. We will not know for sure until we send up satellites that can make better measurements of particles in the air.What happened when the mid 20th century lull came to an end? You guessed it an extremely rapid warming of the planet.So, if past is prologue, this current plateau will end at some point, too, and a new era of rapid global warming will begin. That will put extra energy and moisture into the atmosphere that can fuel weather extremes, like heat waves and torrential rains .We might one day find ourselves looking back on the crazy weather of the 2010s with a deep yearning for those halcyon days."}
{"_id": 18, "text": "NASHVILLE The University of Tennessee faced protests here on Friday over its proposal to let a private company drill for natural gas across a forest controlled by the university. Environmentalists say opening the Cumberland Forest in eastern Tennessee to hydraulic fracturing, a process known as \"fracking,\" could harm wildlife and scenery on the,000 acre tract of state owned land.But the university says it would create a rare, controlled environment in which experts could study the environmental impact of the controversial drilling technique, while also generating revenue to finance research.The State Building Commission voted unanimously on Friday to approve the proposal to open the site up for bidding. Once a company is selected, the commission would need to approve the terms of the contract.Mark Emkes, the head of the state's Department of Finance and Administration, said he was sensitive to environmental concerns but supported the university's position. The forest has been overseen by the university's agriculture department since 1947 and, after decades of strip mining and clean cutting trees by private companies, has been restored to a biologically diverse condition. The university has been considering leasing out the land since.The benefits would be financial and academic, said William F. Brown, the dean of research and director of the university's Agricultural Experiment Station. A private company would lease the mineral rights on a portion of the land and university officials would study the impact of drilling on water and air quality, wildlife and geology and recommend plans for curbing future damage.The gas company would have no control over the research and the university would ensure that safe drilling methods were used, Dr. Brown said. \"We're just trying to conduct unbiased, scientifically sound research,\" he added. \"We're hearing more questions about the environmental impact of natural gas extraction. We feel like we have an obligation to be able to answer those questions.\"But the Southern Environmental Law Center has called the plan \" deeply flawed .\" Gwen Parker, a staff lawyer for the group, said the university was putting finances above health and environmental concerns . The plan creates obvious conflicts of interest, she said, as the research will be financed by the gas companies being studied. Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting huge amounts of water, mixed with sand and chemicals, at high pressures to break up shale formations and release the gas . Environmentalists worry the process could release harmful chemicals that would contaminate drinking water .The financial value of the region's gas is not known, Dr. Brown said. But the university has proposed leasing the land for an initial fee of,000, plus,000 per year and 15 percent royalties on any gas sold.On Friday, several dozen environmentalists marched outside the commission meeting in Nashville. Inside more than 100 people heard 24 speakers argue for or against the university's plan.Kathleen Williams, the executive director of the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, said the forest was one of the most biologically rich and diverse in the country. \"Because we have so much to protect we need to take extra care,\" she said. \"Our motto should be to do no permanent damage while technology keeps up.\""}
{"_id": 18, "text": "WORCESTER, England Britons may remember 2012 as the year the weather spun off its rails in a chaotic concoction of drought, deluge and flooding, but the unpredictability of it all turns out to have been all too predictable Around the world, extreme has become the new commonplace.Especially lately. China is enduring its coldest winter in nearly 30 years. Brazil is in the grip of a dreadful heat spell. Eastern Russia is so freezing minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and counting that the traffic lights recently stopped working in the city of Yakutsk.Bush fires are raging across Australia, fueled by a record shattering heat wave . Pakistan was inundated by unexpected flooding in September. A vicious storm bringing rain, snow and floods just struck the Middle East . And in the United States, scientists confirmed this week what people could have figured out simply by going outside last year was the hottest since records began.\"Each year we have extreme weather, but it's unusual to have so many extreme events around the world at once,\" said Omar Baddour, chief of the data management applications division at the World Meteorological Organization, in Geneva . \"The heat wave in Australia the flooding in the U.K., and most recently the flooding and extensive snowstorm in the Middle East it's already a big year in terms of extreme weather calamity.\"Such events are increasing in intensity as well as frequency, Mr. Baddour said, a sign that climate change is not just about rising temperatures, but also about intense, unpleasant, anomalous weather of all kinds.Here in Britain, people are used to thinking of rain as the wallpaper on life's computer screen an omnipresent, almost comforting background presence. But even the hardiest citizen was rattled by the near biblical fierceness of the rains that bucketed down, and the floods that followed, three different times in.Rescuers plucked people by boat from their swamped homes in St . Asaph, North Wales. Whole areas of the country were cut off when roads and train tracks were inundated at Christmas. In Mevagissey, Cornwall, a pub owner closed his business for good after it flooded 11 times in two months.It was no anomaly the floods of 2012 followed the floods of 2007 and also the floods of, which all told have resulted in nearly.5 billion in insurance payouts. The Met Office, Britain's weather service, declared 2012 the wettest year in England, and the second wettest in Britain as a whole, since records began more than 100 years ago . Four of the five wettest years in the last century have come in the past decade (the fifth was in. The biggest change, said Charles Powell, a spokesman for the Met Office, is the frequency in Britain of \" extreme weather events\" defined as rainfall reaching the top 1 percent of the average amount for that time of year. Fifty years ago, such episodes used to happen every 100 days now they happen every 70 days, he said.The same thing is true in Australia, where bush fires are raging across Tasmania and the current heat wave has come after two of the country's wettest years ever. On Tuesday, Sydney experienced its fifth hottest day since records began in, with the temperature climbing to.1 degrees. The first eight days of 2013 were among the 20 hottest on record.Every decade since the 1950s has been hotter in Australia than the one before, said Mark Stafford Smith, science director of the Climate Adaptation Flagship at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization .To the north, the extremes have swung the other way, with a band of cold settling across Russia and Northern Europe, bringing thick snow and howling winds to Stockholm, Helsinki and Moscow. (Incongruously, there were also severe snowstorms in Sicily and southern Italy for the first time since World War II in December, tornadoes and waterspouts struck the Italian coast.)In Siberia, thousands of people were left without heat when natural gas liquefied in its pipes and water mains burst. Officials canceled bus transportation between cities for fear that roadside breakdowns could lead to deaths from exposure, and motorists were advised not to venture far afield except in columns of two or three cars. In Altai, to the east, traffic officials warned drivers not to use poor quality diesel, saying that it could become viscous in the cold and clog fuel lines.Meanwhile, China is enduring its worst winter in recent memory, with frigid temperatures recorded in Harbin, in the northeast. In the western region of Xinjiang, more than,000 houses collapsed under a relentless onslaught of snow, while in Inner Mongolia, 180,000 livestock froze to death. The cold has wreaked havoc with crops, sending the price of vegetables soaring.Way down in South America, energy analysts say that Brazil may face electricity rationing for the first time since, as a heat wave and a lack of rain deplete the reservoirs for hydroelectric plants. The summer has been punishingly hot. The temperature in Rio de Janeiro climbed to.8 degrees on Dec. 26, the city's highest temperature since official records began in."}
{"_id": 18, "text": "Continued global warming poses a risk of rapid, drastic changes in some human and natural systems, a scientific panel warned Tuesday, citing the possible collapse of polar sea ice, the potential for a mass extinction of plant and animal life and the threat of immense dead zones in the ocean.At the same time, some worst case fears about climate change that have entered the popular imagination can be ruled out as unlikely, at least over the next century, the panel found. These include a sudden belch of methane from the ocean or the Arctic that would fry the planet, as well as a shutdown of the heat circulation in the Atlantic Ocean that would chill nearby land areas the fear on which the 2004 movie \"The Day After Tomorrow\" was loosely based.In a report released Tuesday, the panel appointed by the National Research Council called for the creation of an early warning system to alert society well in advance to changes capable of producing chaos . Nasty climate surprises have occurred already, and more seem inevitable, perhaps within decades, panel members warned. But, they said, little has been done to prepare.\"The reality is that the climate is changing,\" said James W. C. White, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who headed the committee on abrupt impacts of climate change . \"It's going to continue to happen, and it's going to be part of everyday life for centuries to come perhaps longer than that.\"While most climate scientists believe the human release of greenhouse gases has made immense changes in the earth inevitable, they hope many of these will happen slowly enough that society can adapt.The document the panel released Tuesday is the latest in a string of reports to consider whether some changes could occur so suddenly as to produce profound social or environmental stress, even collapse. Like previous reports, the new one considers many potential possibilities and dismisses most of them as unlikely at least in the near term.But some of the risks are real, the panel found, and in several cases have happened already.It cited the outbreak of mountain pine beetles in the American West and in Canada . The disappearance of bitterly cold winter nights that used to kill off the beetles has allowed them to ravage tens of millions of acres of forests, damage so severe it can be seen from space.Likewise, a drastic decline of summer sea ice in the Arctic has occurred much faster than scientists expected. The panel warned that Arctic sea ice could disappear in the summer within several decades, with severe impacts on wildlife and human communities in the region, and unknown effects on the world's weather patterns.Among the greatest risks in coming years, the panel said, is that climate change could greatly increase the extinction rate of plants and animals, essentially provoking the sixth mass extinction in the earth's history. The panel said many of the world's coral reefs, a vital source of fish that feed millions of people, already seemed fated to die within decades.Another risk, judged to be moderately likely over the coming century, is that rising heat in the upper ocean could result in reduced oxygen in the deep. The worst case scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea creatures to survive, with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean, the panel said.It considered the possibility that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean, would greatly increase the rate of sea level rise . It found that risk, in the near term, to be \"unknown but probably low.\"The National Research Council is a nonprofit group in Washington that frequently oversees studies on major scientific questions this study was commissioned by several government agencies ."}
{"_id": 19, "text": "Year after year, the Pittsburgh Penguins are hit hard by injuries to star players, and even more so in the past two seasons . But they continue to win, in large part because of General Manager Ray Shero's foresight and industriousness.In Thursday's 5 2 victory against the Minnesota Wild, only one Penguins defenseman the eight year veteran Matt Niskanen had played more than 62 N.H.L. games. Four were recent products of the Wilkes Barre Scranton Penguins, Pittsburgh's farm club in the American Hockey League .Brian Dumoulin, Philip Samuelsson and Simon Despres were all recent call ups, and Robert Bortuzzo had spent most of the previous four seasons there.A sixth defenseman, the 2012 first round draft pick Olli Maatta, scored on a penalty shot and added an assist against the Wild. He has never played in the A.H.L. but he started against Minnesota having played in only 36 N.H.L. contests.That young crew was augmented by three Penguins forwards Chris Conner, Zach Sill and Harry Zolnierczyk who also began the season with Wilkes Barre Scranton.These fill ins helped the Penguins win their sixth consecutive game, despite the absence of Evgeni Malkin, James Neal, Kris Letang, Brooks Orpik, Paul Martin and five other regulars, to keep Pittsburgh atop the Eastern Conference .\"It's not a new thing,\" said Shero, referring to late last season, when four top players Malkin, Neal, Martin and Sidney Crosby were simultaneously missing. \"We played at a.600 pace without those guys.\"Shero, named the general manager of the year last season, has fortified his team's depth in recent seasons, drafting well and acquiring lots of young talent, even if it has meant trading valuable players like Jordan Staal.He has excelled at projecting his team's needs down the road. With the superstar centers Crosby and Malkin still relatively young, Shero focused on stockpiling defensemen, a position that requires time to master. Shero also aimed to add mobile defensemen after N.H.L. rule changes in 2005 sped up the game.Having previously run Nashville's minor league operation one that funneled defensemen Kimmo Timonen, Shea Weber, Kevin Klein, Greg Zanon, Ryan Suter and Dan Hamhuis to the Predators Shero had recognized the value of a productive farm team before joining Pittsburgh in.He praises many on his staff including Wilkes Barre Scranton Coach John Hynes and the assistant Alain Nasreddine for the work they do out of the limelight to help build that depth.A crucial task in player development is working on prospects' weaknesses. Hynes points to Despres, the Penguins' 2009 first round draft choice, as Exhibit A.After a brief, wobbly playoff performance last spring against the Islanders and a poor training camp this fall, Despres began this season back in Wilkes Barre Scranton.\"He has offensive abilities,\" said Hynes, a 38 year old career coach who played four years at Boston University, \"but what he lacked was his defensive habits, defensive fundamentals and, most importantly, just a mind set of how you have to play when you're under pressure in your defensive zone, how to defend against bigger, stronger players.\"Hynes and Nasreddine, who played 15 professional seasons as a defenseman, improved Despres's defensive skills by playing him against the top opposition lines. They also took him off the power play he did not need to work on those skills and gave him extra work killing penalties.\"That's really what changed his game.\" Hynes said. \"He was able to perfect that down here, and when he went back up to the N.H.L., he was more comfortable it was automatic for him. He's played great.\"The Penguins teach their A.H.L. club to play the same style of hockey as the parent club, so executing all sorts of things in the faster paced N.H.L. becomes similarly automatic.\"They play a certain way because they've been taught to play that way down in Wilkes Barre by John and Naz,\" Shero said. \"They come up, and it's a pretty seamless transition. They know our system.\"Hynes talks regularly by phone with Pittsburgh Coach Dan Bylsma and the assistant general manager, Jason Botterill, whose job is akin to the one Shero had in Nashville. Still, in person contact with the prospects is highly beneficial, and members of the parent club are a regular presence.Tom Fitzgerald and Bill Guerin, former N.H.L. players who are part of Pittsburgh's hockey operations, regularly assist Hynes and Nasreddine on the ice during practices. Hynes has even had Guerin, a Stanley Cup champion with the Devils and the Penguins, behind the bench with him during games.Shero said someone from his staff attended nearly every Wilkes Barre Scranton game.\"It's important for the players to know and the coaches, too that they have our support and we care about their development,\" he said.N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman on Friday heard Boston forward Shawn Thornton's appeal of the 15 game suspension he received for attacking Brooks Orpik.Should Bettman uphold the suspension issued by the league's Department of Player Safety, Thornton has the option to further appeal to James C. Oldham, an independent arbitrator for discipline agreed to by the N.H.L. and the players' association .Under the collective bargaining agreement that went into effect this season, players who have been suspended for six or more games can appeal the commissioner's determination. Previously, an appeal to the commissioner was the final step available to players.No appeal of a suspension has gone yet to Oldham, a law professor at Georgetown University .Buffalo's Patrick Kaleta, whose 10 game suspension earlier this season was upheld by Bettman, declined to pursue the matter further."}

{"_id": 19, "text": "(Reuters) Four years ago when the Chicago Blackhawks won their last Stanley Cup it seemed the only thing their precocious young captain Jonathan Toews could not do was grow a proper playoff beard.Toews finished those playoffs scoring seven goals and 29 points in 22 games, claiming a Conn Smythe trophy as the post season's most valuable player and adding his name on the Stanley Cup .Back in the finals and ready to faceoff against the Boston Bruins in Game One of the best of seven series on Wednesday, Toews is sporting a much more impressive beard this time around but his scoring has not been nearly as striking.With one goal through the first three playoff rounds, Toews' point production may be spotty but his confidence and maturity have grown to the point where he does not obsess over it like he might have earlier in his career.\"When pucks weren't really going in and I didn't seem to be contributing the way I know I could, people can say whatever they want to say,\" Toews told reporters during the Stanley Cup media day on Tuesday. \"But I haven't let it bother me. I haven't let it hurt my confidence.\"I don't think anything in my game has digressed the last couple of years, I think I have only gotten better.\"The easy thing to notice is when you score points but I feel like there are still a lot of good things in my game.\"While Toews waits for his scoring touch to return, the 25 year old Canadian has found other ways to contribute to the Chicago cause.He remains one of hockey's hardest workers, leads all Chicago forwards in ice time and is tops in faceoffs.The only goal that is on Toews' mind these days is not the one he hasn't scored but the team objective of winning another Stanley Cup .\"We (Toews and team mate Patrick Kane ) have both gone through some moments in the playoffs where people are kind of looking at a lack of contribution, we're not really too worried about it,\" said Toews. \"We know there are a lot of good things we can do out there.\"The big reason why we are here is that we play so well as a team...that's the way it's got to be and the way we are going to win this series as well.\"Since Chicago claimed Toews with the third overall pick in the 2006 draft the forward has gone from strength to strength.In his first season he was a finalist for rookie of the year and in his second campaign he was made captain .Nicknamed Captain Serious, Toews has always been viewed as mature beyond his years, providing him with the perspective needed to wait out a scoring slump.\"I think you just get that experience and you understand that, hey, not everything is going to go your way, not everything is going to be seen the same way from different people,\" said Chicago defenseman Duncan Keith.\"I think he's done a good job just keeping a level head. That's what makes him a great player.\"Just, Toews is already a member of the Triple Gold club limited to players with a Stanley Cup and Olympic and world championship titles on their resumes.He has twice played for Canada at the world championships winning gold and silver and was golden again at the Vancouver Winter Games, named to the Olympic all star team.But it is the soft spoken Toews' feisty determination and intensity that are seen as his greatest qualities, leading by example rather than words.\"In 2010 when we went all the way to Stanley Cup final we didn't really know how good our team was,\" recalled Toews. \"We went out there and won games and the next thing you know we were winning the Stanley Cup .\"Coming back here we realize how tough it is, how rare this opportunity is because we worked so hard to get here.\""}

The win their second in two nights after three straight losses gave the Rangers 32 points, lifting them into eighth place, the final playoff spot.The Devils, deprived of a victory they needed just as badly, fell into ninth after their third straight loss .\"Two big wins and four big points after we struggled a little bit,\" Coach John Tortorella said. \"We need to steady ourselves and take it day by day.\"The Rangers faced great expectations at the start of the season, fueled largely by the acquisition of the high scoring Nash from the Columbus Blue Jackets . With a team high 10 goals, Nash has delivered, but the Rangers are a long way from fulfilling those expectations. Devils Coach Peter DeBoer rued the points that got away. \"The effort's been there most every night this year, but we have to start translating that into points,\" he said.The Devils were not expected to contend this season after their captain, Zach Parise, left as a free agent last summer and went to Minnesota . \"I'm not going there,\" DeBoer said, when asked if the Devils missed Parise. \"We have enough here to win more games than we've won lately.\"Both teams' offenses have been anemic.

It looked as if it would be a long night for the goalies.Johan Hedberg, guarding the Devils' net for a 13 th straight game, allowed goals to Michael Del Zotto and Carl Hagelin and finished with 19 saves .Hedberg, whose save percentage coming into the game was a dismal.888, did not look good on Del Zotto's goal, a shorthander that opened the scoring at 11 minutes 49 seconds. He strolled well out of his net to play a puck along the boards but lost it to Derek Stepan . Hedberg retreated to his crease, but was not set when Del Zotto deftly batted Stepan's centering pass out of the air and into the net.\"It's funny, you get so many glorious chances in the slot, and that's the one that goes in for you,\" Del Zotto said about his third goal of the season and the 100th point of his N.H.L. career. Martin Brodeur, a fixture in goal for some 20 years, sat on the Devils' bench, his first time in uniform since Feb. 24. He had been on the injured reserve list with a pinched nerve in his back and neck until being reactivated earlier Tuesday .\"It'll be nice to have him back,\" DeBoer said.Hedberg also didn't look good on Nash's goal at 25 of the second period, a snap shot from 21 feet that went under his glove on the stick hand side. It broke a 2 2 tie .\" Del Zotto made a great pass up the ice,\" Nash said. \"I thought to shoot.\"Nash's goal followed a series of three great stops by Lundqvist during a penalty kill . He allowed first period goals to Travis Zajac and Anton Volchenkov, but nothing else en route to a 29 save victory that came 24 hours after another strong 29 save effort, a 2 1 shootout victory over Carolina .This was the 63rd time Lund qvist played both ends of a back to back set. He won 38 of the previous 62 Game 2's of those sets, with a.92 goals against average and a remarkable.932 save percentage .\"You try to play with a short memory,\" Lundqvist said. \"You have to with the games coming up so fast.\"For the Rangers, a three game losing streak is a distant memory . For the Devils, it's a vexing reality. For both, less than six weeks remain in the struggle to make the playoffs, with little room for error.John Tortorella stopped short of saying the offense starved Rangers would recall Chris Kreider, who has scored six goals in eight games for the Connecticut Whale."}

They were 2 10 4 since then. Cal Clutterbuck scored a short handed, penalty shot goal, and Michael Grabner added a short handed tally in the first period. Defenseman Brian Strait scored in the second, and Grabner added an empty netter with.3 seconds left for the Islanders, who lost a 2 0 lead for the second consecutive game but had four goals for the first time in 15 games.The Rangers got goals from Benoit Pouliot, Derek Dorsett and Derek Stepan, but Henrik Lundqvist stopped only 15 of 19 shots as New York fell to 1 4 2 on its team record, nine game homestand .The Rangers tied it 2 2 just three minutes into the second period when Dorsett's shot from the right wing boards hit Islanders defenseman Thomas Hickey in front and caromed in.The Rangers then grabbed their first lead of the night, but not before Grabner almost scored his second short handed goal of the game. Soon after Grabner's drive struck the crossbar, the Rangers cashed in at the other end.Rick Nash's pass from the boards struck Hickey and caromed to Stepan for a quick shot that produced the power play goal at 58.However, the Islanders responded with 34 left in the second on Strait's first regular season NHL goal, off a feed from Josh Bailey. Prized prospect Ryan Strome earned his first NHL point in his third game. The teams combined for three goals in a span of 57 late in the first period all during Rangers power plays, but only one scored by the home team .With Islanders teammate Andrew MacDonald off for high sticking, Clutterbuck made it 1 0 when he scored on a questionable penalty shot.Clutterbuck was awarded the attempt after he got free for a breakaway with defenseman Ryan McDonagh chasing. McDonagh gave a light check with his stick from behind, and that was enough for the penalty shot to be called much to the dismay of incredulous Rangers coach Alain Vigneault .Clutterbuck netted his fourth of the season when his shot eluded Lundqvist's glove.The Rangers went on their third power play of the period 27 later, and again the Islanders took advantage.The puck got past McDonagh at the point, and the speedy Grabner took off alone. He cut from right to left and tucked the puck inside the left post behind Lundqvist with 51 left in the first.Grabner had gone 31 games without a goal since he netted two on opening night at New Jersey on Oct. 4.The Rangers got one back 30 seconds later on that same power play when Pouliot scored from in close off a pass from Chris Kreider . It was Pouliot's fourth goal.NOTES The Islanders have scored a team record three short handed goals in a game three times. ... Bailey had gone 12 games without a point. ... Strait scored in last season's playoffs. ... Rangers forward J.T. Miller was in the lineup after being recalled from Hartford (AHL) on Thursday."}
{"_id": 19, "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. Rick Nash got what he wanted July 23 when the Columbus Blue Jackets acceded to his trade demands and dealt him to the Rangers . But the circumstances leading to his long awaited debut Saturday against the Boston Bruins are something no one would wish for.Because of the 119 day lockout, Nash, a high scoring forward, had six days this week to learn a new system and establish a rapport with his teammates. He had no choice but to be swept up by the mad dash into what will be an equally frenetic 48 game regular season . The luxury of a full training camp must wait until next season.\"That would have been ideal, but this is the reality of it,\" Nash said Thursday. \"This is the situation I'm in. I've got to get ready that much faster and adjust to the system I'm in and learn everything that goes on here that much faster.\"Nash, 28, is doing everything possible to ease the transition from Columbus, Ohio, to New York. He began living in an apartment in Manhattan in August, not long after the Rangers sent a considerable package to the Blue Jackets for him the forwards Brandon Dubinsky and Artem Anisimov, the defensive prospect Tim Erixon and a first round draft choice in.\"Off the ice, I'm adjusting to the city, to the players and coaches,\" he said. \"On the ice, it's getting better each day. It takes time to learn the system, to figure things out, to figure guys' games out.\"Nash had 30 goals and 29 assists last year and scored at least 30 goals in seven of his nine seasons in Columbus . Nash, a five time All Star, has 289 goals and 547 points in 674 regular season games while emerging as a premier scorer.His continued production depends on how quickly those on the ice with him can learn to play to his strengths, and how quickly they learn to anticipate each other's every move. How many games might that take for a talent laden team favored by some to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup since?\"I don't think you can put a number on it,\" Nash said. \"It's just something you know when it happens.\"It did not help that Brad Richards, who will serve as Nash's center, missed the first three days of training camp with the flu. Richards, too, feels the urgency to quickly produce while appreciating the intricacy of that process. \"He's such a great player,\" Richards said of Nash. \"I don't see too many problems. I'm not saying it's going to be magic, either. But, hopefully, we get it going right away.\"Conditioning will probably not be an issue. Nash played for Davos in the Swiss League for 17 games, registering 12 goals and 6 assists .\"I'm excited to play with him,\" Richards said. \"I'm not really over thinking it and wondering if it's going to work. Definitely, it's going to work to some degree, and how great it's going to be will depend on how we mesh as we go.\"In another indication of the stiff challenges Nash faces, the Rangers did not begin practicing the power play until Thursday. The team's struggles with a man advantage were a major issue when they averaged.15 goals during the postseason and were eliminated by the Devils in six games in the Eastern Conference finals .Tortorella is confident the size and strength of Nash (6 feet 4 inches, 218 pounds) will make a significant difference on the power play . \"He's an elite guy,\" Coach John Tortorella said. \"He can play in a lot of different situations in a lot of different spots.\"Nash is accustomed to high expectations after being the first player taken in the 2002 draft. But Columbus reached the playoffs once in his time there, and made a swift exit after four games in. It may not be until he plays his first home game, on Sunday against the Pittsburgh Penguins and hears the roar of the Madison Square Garden crowd, that he may understand how bright the city lights can be.\"New York is definitely a different place,\" the star goaltender Henrik Lundqvist said. \"There is more pressure. It's maybe not for everybody. But if you do well, there is no place like it.\"REDDEN BOUGHT OUT The Rangers are buying out the final two seasons of Wade Redden's contract. They made the move Thursday, a day after placing Redden, a disappointing defenseman, on waivers. Redden, 35, is now an unrestricted free agent ."}

{"_id": 19, "text": "LOS ANGELES Although Trevor Lewis knows all about postseason heroics after scoring two goals in a Stanley Cup clinching victory last season, even he was a bit overwhelmed by the Los Angeles Kings' latest spectacular playoff feat.With three minutes left, the San Jose Sharks appeared to be cruising toward a well deserved win. After two penalties and two dynamic power play goals, including the winner from Lewis, the Kings were halfway to the Western Conference finals .\"I almost passed out on the celebration,\" Lewis said. \"I got a little light headed. To score a big goal in the playoffs is what you dream about.\" Captain Dustin Brown tied it with 43 left and Lewis scored on a rebound 22 seconds later, propelling the defending Stanley Cup champions to a 4 3 victory Thursday night and a 2 0 series lead.Brown scored during a 5 on 3 advantage and Lewis provided the winner on a loose puck with 21 left, sending Staples Center into shocked celebration. Nobody could believe it not even the Kings, really.\"It's huge, I guess,\" Brown said. \"Two minutes left, down one, it's about capitalizing. The power play is about scoring big goals, and we found a way to do that. We're happy with the result, but we have to play better. We can't let it get to that situation every night.\"The Kings won their 12th straight home game since March and their sixth straight postseason game, but only after getting outplayed for long stretches and needing late game magic to thrive.That's why the Kings didn't celebrate much They know it's asking too much to expect similar luck in Game 3 on Saturday night at the Shark Tank.\"We realize it wasn't our best effort, but sometimes good teams win when they don't deserve it, too,\" said center Anze Kopitar, who spent part of the third period in the dressing room after getting hit in the face by Brown's shot. \"We pulled it off. Next time, we want to make sure we're not in a position like this.\" Jeff Carter scored on the Kings' first shot and added an assist on Brown's goal. Drew Doughty scored an early power play goal for Los Angeles, which didn't really get rolling until the third period after San Jose largely dominated for 40 minutes. Los Angeles already was playing without center Jarret Stoll, out after an illegal hit to the head in the opener from San Jose's Raffi Torres, who was suspended for the series. The Kings missed Stoll most in the faceoff circle, where the Sharks won 68 percent of the draws.But with two late goals, the Kings landed one of the most amazing victories in their relatively thin playoff history, and put the Sharks on the edge of yet another postseason spiral for a sublimely talented team that has never quite got it all together in the playoffs.\"We found a way,\" Los Angeles coach Darryl Sutter said. \"You know what? The power play was on. We've been talking about it. We've been getting good looks and good opportunities and not finishing, and we got it from different guys.\" Jonathan Quick made 28 saves for the Kings, tying Kelly Hrudey's franchise record with his 26th career playoff victory . Antti Niemi stopped 27 shots for the Sharks, but was powerless to stop the Kings' power play late.Marc Edouard Vlasic scored his first career playoff goal with 04 to play for the Sharks, who were doomed by their late penalties after rallying from an early two goal deficit . Coach Todd McLellan left his team alone in the dressing room afterward.\"I liked our game,\" McLellan said. \"We'll meet (Friday) at the rink, and I'll tell our team that. The thing I like about our team, maybe in the past, this would have bothered our team more, but with the group of guys we have, I think we can recover from this.\" Patrick Marleau and Brad Stuart scored second period goals for the Sharks, who largely dominated the first two periods with another barrage of superior speed and skill. None of it mattered when the Kings charged ahead.\"We've got to put it behind us,\" said Stuart, who had a goal and an assist. \"There's two ways for us to respond. We can either fold up and say, 'Oh, at least we tried,' or we can say, 'You know what? We can win.'\"I think 5 on, we were the better team. We keep doing those kinds of things, we'll get our wins. That's what we have to do. We have to respond in that way. We're being tested, and it's about how we're going to respond. The key for us is to come out and do a lot of the same things we were doing tonight.\"After Vlasic's score on a rebound of Stuart's shot off the end boards, the Sharks seemed to be cruising to a win until Stuart was whistled for tripping with 41 to play. Just 22 seconds later, Vlasic joined him in the box when he shot the puck over the glass, although Vlasic claimed the puck had deflected off Carter.The Kings scored 36 seconds later, with Brown pounding home his second goal of the postseason. Lewis got the winner shortly after the ensuing faceoff, finding a loose puck on the back side of a scrum in front of Niemi after a drive to the net and a shot by rookie Tyler Toffoli.Torres was suspended for the rest of the series Thursday after a hearing in New York by the NHL's Department of Player Safety for his illegal check to Stoll's head. Brad Richardson contributed a key power play assist while filling in for Stoll. Los Angeles has won six straight home playoff games dating to last season's Stanley Cup clincher, but none was more surprising than this victory. The Sharks appeared to be sure Quick couldn't steal another win after the Kings took the opener despite getting outshot.Quick's streak of more than 125 minutes of shutout hockey ended in the second period with two quick San Jose goals. Vlasic then gave San Jose its first lead with a rebound goal on Stuart's shot off the end boards midway through the period, capping a lengthy scramble near Quick's net. Vlasic didn't score a goal in his first 73 career playoff games .NOTES Sharks F Adam Burish sat out his second straight game after playing in all four games against Vancouver .

Few doubt that Duke will again be in the mix for the conference and national titles .The stakes were far higher for North Carolina State, which has often been no better than the fourth best team in the state behind Duke, North Carolina and even Wake Forest before the Demon Deacons' recent decline.But before this season, North Carolina State was picked to win the A.C.C. title, raising expectations and the pressure on the team.\"We drew some energy off our fans, no question about it,\" Wolfpack Coach Mark Gottfried said. \"Our guys played really hard they knew this was a big deal.\"Plumlee came in averaging.7 points and.4 rebounds and had 10 points and 8 rebounds in the first half.

North Carolina State was leading by 58 51 with 12 minutes 20 seconds to go, but the Blue Devils climbed back with a Curry 3 pointer from the wing that closed the gap to 58 57 with 32 remaining.But Duke never was able to take the lead. The Wolfpack, who blew a 20 point lead in a loss to Duke last season, built a 67 57 lead with 42 remaining. The Blue Devils closed to 71 67 with 53 to go with another 3 pointer from Curry. But Curry was hurt with 14 left, grabbing his left leg under the Duke basket, and the Blue Devils did not get closer than 4 the rest of the way. Krzyzewski said Curry slipped on a wet floor and injured his ankle, but did not indicate the injury was serious. As for Kelly, there was no telling when he might be able to return.\"We don't know Ryan's situation,\" Plumlee said. \"We're moving forward . This is who we have. We're still Duke .

The Wildcats (26 7) dominated the Bruins (26 7) wire to wire in their tournament opener in Salt Lake City .It was the sixth N.C.A.A. appearance for Belmont, the No. 11 seed, without a victory.

Of those field goals, the sharpshooter Ian Clark made five.For a team that made the third most 3 pointers in Division I since, it was a disaster, the worst case scenario . The Wildcats, though, had something to do with that.It was a matter of distance. Belmont took jump shots . Arizona pounded the ball inside . It scored more points in the paint (8 6) and more second chance points (8 0) in the first half. It also outrebounded the Bruins by what looked like a misprint 27 9.

{"_id": 20, "text": "WASHINGTON This was the first glimpse, a tantalizing but precursory peek, at what a 183 million team looks like.It is inadvisable to conclude much about a team based on any preseason game, let alone a maiden one. For the record, the Nets beat the Washington Wizards, 111 106, in overtime at Verizon Center. But even Coach Jason Kidd said an hour before the game that its result was trivial.That the contest felt noteworthy at all, then, was almost purely for aesthetic reasons.Months have passed since the Nets underwent their lavish remodeling, one that ensured they would have a former All Star playing at every position and that trophy hopes would come across as credible. For this, they have a 101 million payroll, by far the league's highest sum and one that will lead to a projected 82 million luxury tax statement. Still, in recent weeks, every last comment or boast or prediction about the team seemed to have a qualifier \"on paper\" attached or at least implied.On Tuesday, finally, there was the team, pulled off the figurative paper and realized on the court .For fans and observers, some sights may require an adjustment period. Paul Pierce, who had spent all of his 15 seasons with the Boston Celtics, and Kevin Garnett, who had played his previous six seasons alongside Pierce, made their debuts.As the first two players introduced before the game, Pierce and Garnett skipped onto the court and bumped fists. Fifteen seconds into the game, Pierce sank the Nets' first basket, and half a minute later, Garnett grabbed the team's first offensive rebound. These were familiar sights, rendered black and white .\"I honestly didn't even think about it,\" Pierce said about wearing a new uniform. \"I've been part of the Brooklyn Nets . We've been practicing.\" Pierce and Garnett were limited to 12 minutes 29 seconds, as were center Brook Lopez and guard Joe Johnson . During that brief time, Lopez, who should remain the offensive focal point on this team, stamped around at will and scored 15 points . Forward Andrei Kirilenko, another new face, was a dynamic presence on the second unit, hopping from one spot to another over 31, collecting 11 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals .The numbers were secondary to the visuals and individual gestures, though. And the unfamiliar sights were not limited to the playing area. Kidd, beginning his first season as the coach, joked before the game that he would not know where to stand on the sideline. By the time he made his way there, he had changed into a gray suit and a tie.\"It was weird, I'll be honest, seeing him in his little tight suit, drawing up plays,\" Garnett said about Kidd .Some key absences made the Nets' preliminary showcase feel incomplete. Deron Williams, who sprained his ankle last month and has not been cleared for full contact at practice, watched from the bench. The way he molds his game to his new teammates and whether he can rediscover his form, which withered some the past two seasons is a compelling subplot that will need to wait.The reserves Jason Terry and Tornike Shengelia, both recovering from knee surgery, and Gary Forbes, who was sick, were inactive, too. Kidd said before the game that he was not worried about getting up to speed before the regular season, but he conceded that the team's unfamiliarity with one another was an area to address.\"When you look at the other teams in this league, they've been together,\" Kidd said. \"That's something we're a little bit behind on.\"But that bonding time will come. The Nets have six more preseason games before their Oct. 30 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers .On Tuesday, it was about observing the new teammates competing together for the first time, to see a hypothetical contender actualized on the court ."}

All around him people are talking about the glory days of Nevada Las Vegas basketball, but the man, Jerry Tarkanian the Shark, the coach who won more than 700 games, earned a national championship and went to four Final Fours, all while fighting the N.C.A.A. and chomping wet towels on the sideline stays mum.When Harvey Hyde, a former U.N.L.V. football coach, recalls how Frank Sinatra tried to help with basketball recruiting a few times, Tarkanian barely raises his head. (Sinatra was not all that successful one of his targets, a New York prospect named Jim Graziano, went to South Carolina to play for Frank McGuire instead.)When Brad Rothermel, the former athletic director, laughs as he recalls the day Tarkanian heard some assistant coaches talking about how Bo Derek \"was a 10\" and said, with absolute sincerity, \"We need to start recruiting him right away,\" Tarkanian does not chortle with the rest. He does not even look up.The stories keep flowing the time when Tarkanian nearly got the coaching job at Indiana (the Hoosiers ended up hiring a man named Bob Knight the back story to his nickname (it came from a Los Angeles Times columnist even the history of Tarkanian's predilection for sucking on those towels. His son, Danny, explains that Tarkanian began the practice while coaching a high school team that played in a gym so hot it perpetually left Tarkanian with cotton mouth.\"He couldn't very well keep running to the water fountain!\" Danny says. The others giggle Tarkanian barely moves.As glasses clink and the room fills around them, Tarkanian stays hunched over, his fork going up and down slowly, like a rickety elevator. At one point Danny whispers beneath the din, \"You O.K., Dad?\" and Tarkanian stirs. \"I'm... good,\" he croaks, but then he stares, quizzically, as Danny gestures over and over at his own chin. Eventually, Danny sighs after a quick glance around, he surreptitiously reaches across the table to wipe a speck of salad from his father's mouth.\"It is different now,\" Danny says softly to the man sitting next to him. \"There are different issues.\"Jerry Tarkanian is. His health, which began deteriorating about four years ago when he fell while walking in San Diego, has declined to the point that basic movements are difficult. When someone comes by for an introduction during the meal at Landry's, Tarkanian shakes hands with his left hand because his right is anchored to the table, as if to keep him from slumping over. His eyes, which drooped like week old balloons when he was, now seem to hang to his neck. After eating, as Tarkanian makes his way to the parking lot, he hesitates as he steps down from the curb, putting his hand on the shoulder of a visitor and grunting hard as he guides his walker a few inches in front of him.His Division I coaching career, which covered 31 seasons, 3 colleges and countless hearings, depositions and court dates as he fought the governing body of the sport he loves, feels far away. In the car on the way back to the family home, a two story Spanish style house that Tarkanian and his wife, Lois, bought in, he is asked about his years of plenty. He nods twice when the championship team of 1990 is mentioned. He shakes his head when asked to remember coaching against John Wooden. \"Played him three times,\" he says slowly. \"Lost all three.\" He looks out the window. \"Should have won one of them.\"As the car pulls into the driveway, past the mailbox with the basketball on it and around the corner from the small backyard court where friends and relatives and college students and celebrities have played casual games, Tarkanian is asked if he still watches basketball . For the first time all day, his face brightens. He smiles. \"It's on all the time,\" he says. \"We didn't have so much TV when I was coaching.\"And what does he think when he watches these days? Tarkanian turns in his seat and hacks through a laugh. It is almost as if he is trying to chuckle.\"I think,\" he says as he wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, \"that it looks familiar.\""}
{"_id": 20, "text": "The beige buildings collectively known as Industry City form narrow cobblestone canyons perpendicular to the Sunset Park waterfront. The loud roar of vehicles speeding down the nearby Gowanus Expressway gives way toward the west to the slow rumble of trucks creeping across the uneven streets.Within this complex, the Nets are eyeing a remote, ramshackle warehouse close to Gowanus Bay as the final step in their long evolution into legitimate Brooklynites.The team has signed a tentative deal to build its new base of basketball operations atop a building on 39th Street, according to multiple people briefed on the plans. If the deal goes through, the landlord will raise the roof about 15 feet, allowing the team to install practice courts and training rooms. The team's front office will be housed there, too.The project, which has yet to be officially announced by the Nets, is expected to be completed by the fall of. If that happens, the Nets will leave their training center in East Rutherford, N.J., and drop the last vestige of their former incarnation.\"The Nets are a forward thinking organization,\" said Michael Phillips, chief operating officer of Jamestown, a real estate firm that recently bought a large stake in Industry City. \"It's a great day for Sunset Park and the Nets .\"The Nets played in New Jersey from 1977 to 2012 before leaving for Barclays Center on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, a move that reshaped the surrounding neighborhoods. But the team has maintained a dual presence, continuing to hold most practices at an office park in New Jersey, where most of the basketball staff works. The Nets have spent months looking for a new site to practice.If their plans hold firm, the Nets will find themselves practicing on a street as peaceful as a nature preserve, in a working class area of bodegas, live poultry stores and auto repair shops .The neighborhood is in an intriguing state of transition. Sunset Park is home to a large Latino population as well as Brooklyn's Chinatown . With the impending move, the Nets have inserted themselves into a Brooklyn neighborhood that has reinvented itself several times in the past few decades, and seems poised for more change to come.The warehouse at 148 39th Street, just west of Second Avenue is one of 16 that make up the.5 million square foot Industry City. The group of buildings, called Bush Terminal until the 1980s, has been in operation since the late 1800s. It was once the largest multiple tenant industrial complex in the country, combining manufacturing and warehousing with easy access to shipping.In the past few years, the buildings have begun to attract artists drawn to the affordable studio space. More recently, the landlords committed to a full out renewal of the complex. The buildings now house a mixture of artist studios, light manufacturers, technology firms and other creative minded tenants, many of whom moved in within the last two years. On a recent morning, people carrying portfolios and artists' tubes trickled into Industry City from the direction of the 36th Street subway stop.\"There's not a lot going on here,\" said Tomas Cruz, an employee at Colson Patisserie, which opened recently on the ground floor of one Industry City building. \"But it feels like there's a lot that's starting to happen.\"Cruz said the arrival of an N.B.A. team could attract more business to the area. Chris Havens, a commercial property broker specializing in Brooklyn real estate, said the area could aspire to be something like Dumbo, a neighborhood about five miles away that has been transformed from a gritty outpost to a creative, high priced hub.The Nets' building is separated from the main Industry City cluster by a Costco store and a vast parking lot . A strip club called Peyton's Playpen sits nearby.The team wants to open a Nets store at street level, according to people who know of the plans. The Nets are also expected to integrate the organization into the community through basketball clinics, public events and other means.The team declined to comment on the move, which was first reported on the website Nets Daily.Jeremy Laufer, the district manager of the local community board, said he had heard talk of the plans and would welcome the Nets to the neighborhood, especially if it meant more jobs . He noted Sunset Park was far below the city average for park and recreation space per capita .\"I think it's a positive thing for the community, a recognition that this is a community on the rise and that it has some strong assets that have not been realized in the past,\" said Laufer, who said he was a Knicks fan.The move also spurs the possibility that a Nets player will become a Brooklyn resident, something that has not happened since the team moved. Most of the current roster lives in northern New Jersey, with a few in Lower Manhattan.Some artists are concerned that the Nets' potential move represents the beginning of the end of their time in the complex. Karen Lederer, a 27 year old artist from Prospect Heights who makes paintings and prints inspired by knitted textiles, said she and her studio mate had wondered whether the aesthetic improvements in their Industry City building augured a rent hike.Lederer, who has worked in the complex for a little over a year, laughed as she recounted a story about a recent visitor who noticed the clean tiles and curved faucets inside a renovated public restroom \"He said, 'This bathroom is way too nice. It doesn't spell good things for you.' \"Such signs have long marked the cycle of change in Brooklyn. The Nets' arrival would symbolize another."}
{"_id": 20, "text": "When Louisville arrives at Madison Square Garden to play in the Big East tournament usually after preliminary rounds it sometimes seems as if a switch is flipped, and the action on the court zips to fast forward, with players and colors whirring by in hazy streaks.The Cardinals call their style \"havoc,\" which looks roughly like the basketball equivalent of a football team's punt block unit over 40 minutes all outstretched arms and legs . Louisville Coach Rick Pitino has long kept track of how many deflections his team accrues each game, a measure of that havoc, and he said proudly that Thursday night's total of 58 against Villanova was the most he could ever remember.\"To get 40 is a lot,\" Pitino said. \"We had 38 at halftime.\"The result was a lopsided quarterfinal win, 74 55, over the Wildcats, who left the court looking dazed. The second seeded Cardinals (27 5) won last year's Big East tournament with a similar blend of timely scoring, tough rebounding and tireless defensive activity.In fact, in this tournament where physical, at times plodding, play has been the norm Louisville seems to redefine the term \"active defense.\" The Cardinals pursued the ball like dogs scrambling for a fallen slice of bacon.They were unrelenting, a flash of white and red hawking the orange ball. Villanova (20 13) struggled to get it past halfcourt. Not just in the first few minutes or the first half. The entire game .\"We were very intense,\" Pitino said. \"We were really quick. We were fast.\" Wildcats Coach Jay Wright spent much of the game on the sideline shaking his head . Villanova beat Louisville, 73 64, earlier this season, the beginning of its climb up the Big East Conference standings, to the No. 7 seed.But the Wildcats did not seem quite prepared for the assault they received from a Cardinals team with deep tournament experience and, more important, fresh legs after five days of rest.\"Their guards just completely dominated the game,\" Wright said. \"We just did not respond to the physical play.\" Villanova finished with 25 turnovers, leading to 27 Louisville points. The Cardinals shot.2 percent from the field in the second half and held the Wildcats to just 2 for 12 shooting from beyond the arc in the game.\"When we shoot the ball like we did tonight and share the basketball like that, we're a pretty tough team because of our defense,\" Pitino said.Louisville's Russ Smith had a game high 28 points while playing with a heavy heart.Hours before the game, Smith called his high school, Archbishop Molloy in Queens, as he likes to do when he returns home to New York. The athletic director, Mike McCleary, informed Smith that the school's celebrated coach, Jack Curran, had died in his sleep Thursday morning .\"It was really hard for me to take it all in,\" Smith said. \"I really have no words.\"Smith said he cried on the bus for 45 minutes. He considered Curran, who won 972 games and coached New York basketball stars like Kenny Smith and Kenny Anderson, to be a father figure.\"One of the main things Coach said was, the road to success is always under construction,\" Smith said. \"I always say that, and I'll always work around that little quote.\"He said he dedicated Thursday's performance and the rest of the tournament to Curran, and Pitino echoed him.\"I just told Russ we have to play this tournament and in the N.C.A.A. for Coach Curran,\" Pitino said. \"It's very exciting that Russ could have that type of game and honor his coach like that.\"Smith, whose play off the bench propelled Louisville to the Final Four last year, finished second in the Big East in scoring during the regular season . He is the archetypal Louisville player always in motion.This game, he swallowed his emotions to put on a show.\"I wanted to do anything I could to win,\" Smith said. \"Today was definitely Coach Curran Day for me, and it will be the rest of my life.\"In the second game of the night, sixth seeded Notre Dame came back from a big early deficit to beat third seeded Marquette, 73 65. The Fighting Irish will play Louisville in Friday night's semifinals. Notre Dame fell behind, 17 4, but climbed back to go into halftime ahead by. This was largely without the team's star forward, Jack Cooley, who was held to 2 points on 1 of 3 shooting with zero rebounds in the first half.\"To be up 4 after being down, 17 4, I'm ready to have a parade,\" Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey said.In the second half, the game swung back and forth, with neither team taking more than a 4 point lead until Pat Connaughton hit a 3 pointer with 3 minutes 23 seconds remaining . That put Notre Dame ahead by.Connaughton added another big 3 shortly after, and he finished with 18 points . Connaughton, a sophomore guard, is 12 of 18 from beyond the arc in two games this tournament.The Irish beat Louisville, 104 101, in five overtimes on Feb. 9.\"Here we go again,\" Brey said."}
{"_id": 20, "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. Carmelo Anthony acknowledged that the Knicks were concerned about Coach Mike Woodson's job security . A television reporter asked Kenyon Martin if he hated the Nets . Iman Shumpert bolted for the security of the locker room . Metta World Peace said he got into a fight over pasta.In other words, it was Tuesday.Nothing is normal for the Knicks, especially this season, so it was pretty much business as usual for the team two days ahead of Thursday's showdown with the Nets . The end of practice meant more questions about Woodson's being on the hot seat . More questions about Anthony's leadership abilities. More questions about their nine game losing streak . And more questions about public and private spats between teammates, their collective patience wearing thin.\"I mean, that's basketball,\" Woodson said. \"If you've ever played any kind of sports, that happens. Sometimes, it's healthy, I think.\"One such flare up played out during the third quarter of Sunday's loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, when Shumpert and Anthony bickered over a defensive miscommunication. Shumpert, whom the team has tried to trade in recent weeks, did not play in the fourth quarter .\"That had nothing to do with anything,\" Woodson said. \"Everybody points the finger and tries to reach for certain things, and I'm not going to allow that to happen.\"He can try, of course, but nothing exists in a vacuum not in this city, and not when it comes to this team. The Knicks' struggles drew a full fleet of news cameras to the team's training facility, and World Peace seemed unimpressed with the disheveled, microphone toting mass of humanity that assembled before him.\"You guys look horrible,\" he said.It was an atypical moment for World Peace, who was otherwise brimming with optimism. He said everyone on the team was trying hard to win games \"pushing, pushing, pushing,\" he said and cited some intense practices. He said the team's goal was still to win a championship, which might have been the boldest thing anyone in the league had said all season. Or any season, for that matter. World Peace was undeterred.\"It's like when you're home and your son is doing bad in math class, and your goal for him does not change, right?\" he said. \"You still want him to be a really good kid, right? And good at math. 'Go do it, son!' That's how we are here 'Do it, Knicks ! Do it!' \"As for a squabble with Martin before Sunday's game first reported by ESPN New York, World Peace said they merely had a disagreement about pasta.\"He had elbow pasta, and I had shell pasta,\" he said, \"and I told him how my shell pasta was better than his elbow pasta, and he was pretty upset about that.\"He appeared to be joking, but it is impossible to know for sure with World Peace . He dismissed talk of locker room friction by saying, \"There's no various nothing.\"The Knicks are facing serious challenges, though familiar challenges that have lingered for days and weeks. Their pick and roll defense, in particular, is a chemical spill. Their late game decisions are lacking. Their confidence has evaporated.\"We're not in a great state, to just be frank about that,\" said Anthony, who added that he understood why people were asking about Woodson's status. \"Welcome to New York. It happens. I mean, anytime you're in a situation like this, people try to figure out what's next. Right now, it's him. Yesterday, it might have been me.\"Martin said he had a hard time comprehending the team's 3 13 record. There is too much talent on the roster, he said, for the team to be so terrible. He said a potential turnaround was all about the players \"caring.\" He threw in some profanity for good measure, in case anyone doubted his sincerity.\"So that's the frustration,\" Martin said. \"When you don't expect to win, it's easy to go out and be like, 'Oh, well.' We expect to win.\"Martin rejected the suggestion that Woodson's job was in jeopardy, saying it was up to the players to perform. Martin said he conveyed that message to Woodson in a meeting several weeks ago . And although the season has since soured, Martin's attitude has not changed.\"He's put us in the best situations, with the best scouting reports,\" Martin said. \"We're just not getting it done on the court, so it's on us.\"A couple of weeks ago, Woodson talked about needing to \"put the fire out.\" On Tuesday, he said he had to \"stop the bleeding.\" The Knicks' season has become a sliding scale of calamities (open wounds are worse than fires, apparently, and few seem to envy Woodson .At the very least, he has the sympathy of George Karl, who was fired as the coach of the Denver Nuggets at the end of last season. In an interview that was posted online last week by the Denver based sportswriter Dave Krieger, Karl addressed the Knicks' situation.\"I mean, I watch the Knicks play and I wouldn't want to be in that hell for a million dollars,\" Karl said. Woodson, meantime, has stuck to his usual themes of valuing every game, of doing his best to tune out the static, of striving for improvement.\"No, it's not panic time,\" he said. \"We just got to figure out how to win a game.\""}

McGary helped Michigan reach the Final Four last season when he was a freshman, and he was a preseason all American selection after deciding to return to the Wolverines rather than enter the N.B.A. draft.Now Michigan's hopes for another run through the N.C.A.A. tournament have taken a hit.\"We met with a lot of people, and Mitch decided his best interest for his long term health is to go ahead and have surgery,\" Coach John Beilein said. \"Right now, he's out indefinitely. That may mean the end of the season. We do not know. It depends a lot on the surgery and the rehab.\"Beilein and McGary met with reporters Friday, a day before Michigan was to play Holy Cross. McGary missed the first two games of the season because of the back problem. In eight games since, he has averaged.5 points.The 6 foot 10 McGary did not play in Michigan's 68 65 win over Stanford last weekend.\"I just tried to rehab,\" McGary said. \"It's just kind of painful to play through it.\" Michigan said its medical staff expected a full recovery for McGary, who said his back had been a problem since late August.\"I just kind of injured myself during the preseason,\" McGary said. \"I just tried to rehab the whole time.\"Beilein said Friday that surgery was an option in the immediate aftermath of the injury. Instead, McGary returned and was able to contribute.He had 15 points and 14 rebounds in a loss at Duke this month. But the Wolverines struggled inside in a loss to Arizona on Dec. 14, and McGary has not played since.\"The week before the Arizona game, he couldn't practice very well,\" Beilein said. \"He didn't practice hardly at all before the Stanford game. Didn't feel that was going to change unless he had this surgery.\" Michigan will now turn to a couple of experienced big men Jordan Morgan and Jon Horford to hold down the fort inside. Both have played plenty of minutes for the Wolverines throughout the years, but they will have to avoid getting into foul trouble . Neither will have an easy time replacing McGary's offensive ability and his aggressive rebounding around the basket.

Roddick announced his retirement at the United States Open two months later.As Roger Federer said goodbye to the more than,000 fans who watched him lose a semifinal match to Rafael Nadal on Sunday, his departure from the ATP World Tour Finals seemed nondescript. With a bag over each shoulder, he waved with one hand, then another, and made the short walk to the locker room at O2 Arena.Unless Federer does an about face, retirement is not in his immediate future.\"Why just walk away?\" said Federer, who clearly wants to return to the elite eight man event he has claimed a record six times.But given that Federer will be 33 by the time of the 2014 season ending championships, that he endured further back problems in the summer and that he did not qualify for this year's tournament until two weeks ago in Paris, the question still arose Could this be his last visit to the World Tour Finals ?\"No, I don't think so,\" the television analyst and former South African player Robbie Koenig said. \"I think what we've seen at the tail end of the season is a much healthier Federer .\"It's been a positive end to the season for him, and I think he's going to take that into next year.\" Federer can start pondering next year in earnest after his, 6 3 loss. This was Nadal's first victory indoors against Federer in five tries, improving his overall record in the rivalry to.Nadal's opponent in Monday's final is Novak Djokovic, who extended his winning streak to 21 matches by beating Federer's fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, 6 3, 6 3. Wawrinka said he and Federer chatted about their semifinal opponents Sunday morning, although any tips they shared judging by the results did not help. Federer was coming off a two and a half hour win on Saturday against Juan Mart n del Potro . The slugfest featured between the legs shots from del Potro and a no look, over the shoulder lob from Federer .He earned the opening three break points at on the second, with ample space down the line, he erred on his increasingly erratic forehand. Federer had complained Saturday that statisticians at the World Tour Finals were harsh, but even he could have no argument about the miss being categorized as an unforced error. Nadal broke for 5 4 but was then broken himself, in a game highlighted by Federer's capping a 30 shot rally with a forehand winner.By the end of the first set, though, Federer's first serve percentage dipped and rallies became extended, both to Nadal's liking.On his second opportunity, Nadal served out the set to love.He did not face a break point in the second, with Federer's forays to the net proving largely unsuccessful. Federer seemed to be disappointed in the speed of the court .\"It's unbelievable that he gets away with playing so far back indoors these days,\" he said of Nadal, \"but that's the conditions.\" Djokovic also chose to play mainly behind the baseline and allow Wawrinka, who compiled a hefty 10 unforced errors through four games, to dictate much of the first set. Djokovic struck his first winner in the ninth game.Djokovic's forehand passing shot on a full stretch energized spectators in a second set in which Wawrinka trailed in each of his service games.The match resembled Djokovic's recent straight set win over Wawrinka in Paris rather than their five set thrillers at the United States Open in September and at the Australian Open in January .The final between Nadal, who is guaranteed to finish 2013 at No. 1, and Djokovic is the perfect end to the season, according to Koenig.\"You have the guy who is the best player in the world and the guy who is probably the hottest player in the world,\" he said."}
{"_id": 21, "text": "The former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki's streak of early Grand Slam exits continued Saturday, when she was eliminated in the third round of the United States Open .The eighth ranked Wozniacki, who had spent 67 weeks as the world's top ranked player but has failed to capture a major tournament title, had not been able to advance out of the fourth round at the season's previous three Grand Slams .The Open appeared to offer her best opportunity to play deeper into the tournament and quiet some of her doubters. She had dispatched Ying Ying Duan of China and cruised past Chanelle Scheepers of South Africa in the first two rounds, and the draw had developed nicely for Wozniacki, who next faced the 136th ranked Camila Giorgi. If she could get by Giorgi, she would not face a higher seeded opponent until the semifinals at the earliest.But Giorgi, a 21 year old qualifier from Italy, was an aggressive ball striker who could cause her headaches. From the start, Giorgi challenged Wozniacki on her way to a, 6 4, 6 3 victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and sent Wozniacki to another early exit.The seventh seeded Roger Federer restored some order to the night session at Ashe, breezing past Adrian Mannarino of France, 6 3, 6 0, 6 2, in 1 hour 21 minutes.Early on it appeared Wozniacki might also have an easier night. In the first set, when Giorgi hit the net at 4 4 and gave Wozniacki a break point, Wozniacki held her left fist high and firm, appearing energized. She won the set, and it seemed then that she would maintain control.But Giorgi charged back in the second set, hitting 17 winners to Wozniacki's. Giorgi began to dictate the pace of the match. She had the speed to track down Wozniacki's returns, the power to beat Wozniacki with her forehand, and the energy to keep it up.\"She put me under pressure and I started to play a little short, and then all of a sudden she was all over the ball,\" Wozniacki said, adding, \"She was going for the lines and she was hitting them when she wanted to.\"Giorgi controlled the third set the same way, ending the match with a strong forehand down the line that Wozniacki could only lunge at. Now it was Giorgi who pumped her fist, and Wozniacki waved halfheartedly, clearly dejected, as she left the court .Giorgi smiled wide as the crowd cheered. She will next face fellow Italian Roberta Vinci, the No. 10 seed, with a berth in the quarterfinals at stake.Asked why she thought she won, Giorgi said the reason was tactical. Asked to explain her tactics, she said, \"Just when the ball came, just hit the ball in the corners.\"She added, \"I hope to stay like this for the last week.\" Wozniacki exited in the first round at the Open last year, as she dealt with a right knee injury . It was yet another disappointment, after she had lost in the first round at Wimbledon that year, and after she had reached the semifinals at the Open the two previous years, in 2011 and, and the final in. Wozniacki has not advanced to the semifinals of a Grand Slam since she did so at the Open in, a trend she had hoped to change this season.\"It wasn't the best year for me at the majors,\" Wozniacki said, \"but, you know, there is a next year.\"As Giorgi was completing her upset of Wozniacki, Daniel Evans, the 23 year old qualifier from Britain, fell apart against Tommy Robredo, the No. 19 seed from Spain, at Louis Armstrong Stadium, 7 6 (6), 6 1, 4 6, 7 5.Evans had reached the third round despite being ranked No. 179 in the world. He upset the No. 11 seed Kei Nishikori of Japan in the first round in straight sets. He practiced Wednesday with Roger Federer, and then beat Bernard Tomic of Australia on Thursday in four sets. Federer had complimented Evans's game after their practice session, saying he had \"a great shot,\" and for much of the first set, Evans lived up to his previous play and Federer's words. He pumped forehands into the corners, making Robredo work, and spun shots with his one handed backhand, but Robredo outlasted him in the tiebreaker.Evans swore at his miscues, as he flopped in the second. But he played a cleaner third, settled into his serve, and broke Robredo to stay alive. Then for a moment, when Robredo appeared to attend to a leg injury, there seemed to be a chance that Evans would rally and continue his run in this tournament. But Robredo mustered enough energy to finish off Evans in the fourth set .So Robredo, not Evans, will face Federer in the fourth round ."}
{"_id": 21, "text": "WASHINGTON For most athletes, induction to their sport's hall of fame would be an ending of sorts. But for Martina Hingis, it was just another beginning.Days after her induction to the International Tennis Hall of Fame earlier this month, for which she had to be retired for five years to be eligible, Hingis announced that she would un retire for the second time. Hingis, who turned pro at 14 and retired for the first time at, is only, about a year older than Roger Federer and Serena Williams .She will return to competition this week at the Southern California Open in Carlsbad, playing doubles with Daniela Hantuchova .\"I feel good in doubles,\" Hingis said shortly after her announcement. \"I always said I was a much better doubles player than a singles player, because the hands I always had, obviously. The intelligence about doubles is about teamwork, and it's also necessary to have the right partner, and I think in Daniela, I have a great partner. We'll just see how it goes.\" Hingis has committed to four events after Carlsbad in Toronto in Mason, Ohio in New Haven and the United States Open . She plans to play all five tournaments with Hantuchova, a friend and tour veteran from Slovakia, where Hingis was born. Hingis began her professional career in 1994 and won five Grand Slam singles titles by. She spent 209 weeks at No. 1 in the WTA singles rankings, the fourth most ever. Hingis also won nine Grand Slam women's doubles titles and spent 35 weeks at No. 1 in doubles.She first retired in early 2003 at 22 because of nagging foot and ankle injuries, which led to a lawsuit against her shoe sponsor Sergio Tacchini. She occupied her time at home in Switzerland, studying English and riding horses.In early, Hingis returned to play a small WTA tournament in Thailand, then played World TeamTennis in the summer before announcing a full time comeback to the tour, which began in.That comeback included a run to the Australian Open quarterfinals in her first month back, as well as titles at large tournaments in Rome and in Tokyo, and a peak of No. 6 in the rankings.But at the end of the 2007 season, Hingis was revealed to have tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon . A trace amount was detected in a urinalysis. Hingis was handed a two year suspension and was barred from the grounds of all tournaments . She retired again the day the test result was revealed.The ban lapsed in, but it took a lasting emotional toll, said Lindsay Davenport, an old rival but a close friend.\"That definitely scarred her emotionally,\" Davenport said. \"That was not easy for her. And then to be not welcome in tennis for two years you forget, you're not even allowed to go watch. And that hurt her deeply. And so I think when that was lifted, she wasn't exactly ready to re embrace the tennis world. It took her a little while to heal from those wounds and get to a place where she felt that she had moved past that.\"At a show jumping competition in, Hingis met the French equestrian Thibault Hutin, and married him later that year. But the demise of their marriage has recently become tabloid fodder in Switzerland, proving a distraction that Davenport says has further pushed Hingis toward recommitting to tennis.\"I think she needs something else to focus on,\" said Davenport. \"And that's been the tennis.\" Hingis had worked as a coach for Mouratoglou Academy in Paris since, and this spring, she returned to the tour as the coach of the Russian player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova . Practicing and traveling with Pavlyuchenkova, Hingis felt comfortable back in the environs of the tour and felt ready to compete again. Hingis has eased into competition the way she did in, by playing World TeamTennis, this time with the dominant Washington Kastles . Although Hingis said a return to singles on tour was not something she was considering, she won all but one of her singles matches during the season.She drew particular confidence from a 5 1 rout of Eugenie Bouchard, a highly regarded Canadian teenager who was then ranked 56th.\"I was impressed,\" Hingis said of her own form. \"She's 56 in the world, right? So I was feeling pretty good about that one.\"Her singles form seemed to impress more than just herself the Kastles' owner, Mark Ein, said that Serena Williams, in attendance at one of the Kastles' matches, told him she believed Hingis would be \"top, for sure\" if she came back to singles.Davenport and the retired doubles specialist Rennae Stubbs have predicted Hingis will return to singles at some point, but for now, her comeback remains limited to doubles. Covering half the court is less physically demanding, and Hingis said the difficulty of doubles competition was down significantly since the early part of her career, when top singles players like her and Davenport regularly played in both disciplines.\"Today, you don't see that anymore,\" Hingis said. \"So I think the doubles level has dropped, actually. So that's why I thought, eh, we see how that goes.\"A foray into mixed doubles is likely at the United States Open, the event for which she is perhaps best suited.In the World TeamTennis final Sunday night in Washington, which the Kastles won by 25 12 over the Springfield Lasers, Hingis put an exclamation point on her season by capably fending off the big serving Andy Roddick in mixed doubles . Hingis was able to return six of Roddick's seven serves, and she and her partner, Leander Paes, won five of the six ensuing points. The performance left Roddick, who retired from the tour last September, with little doubt about Hingis's chances of a successful return to top level competition.\"She has probably the best racket skills of any female player I've seen, maybe her and Justine,\" Roddick said, referring to the retired Justine Henin. \"If she's playing doubles and the ball comes to her, she doesn't miss many. She's going to be the smartest one out there. Yeah, I'm not worried about her chances.\"When asked how she succeeded against Roddick's booming serve, Hingis gave a big smile and a short explanation.\"I was ready,\" she said, beaming."}

{"_id": 21, "text": "PARIS Richard Gasquet knew what was coming when the match hit the three and a half hour mark and Stanislas Wawrinka began breathing down his neck as the local favorite again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory at the French Open .Swiss ninth seed Wawrinka, who will meet seven times champion Rafa Nadal, prevailed 6 7(5) 4 6 6 4 7 5 8 6 to book his place in the last eight after Gasquet threw away a two set lead at a major for the fifth time on Monday.In, Gasquet overcame a two set deficit at Wimbledon to knock out Andy Roddick in his only grand slam quarter final appearance.The Frenchman then suffered a cruel reversal of fortune, tripping at the last 16 hurdle 11 times.\"I know very well that after three and a half hours I will be a bit tired,\" Gasquet, who strolled through the previous rounds and was poised to become the only man in the draw to reach the quarters without dropping a set, told a news conference .\"The match was not for me today, simply,\" the Frenchman said after a four hour 16 minute dogfight featuring 149 winners and several impressive one handed backhand exchanges .\"That's all I can do. I can't give more than I gave today. He played such incredible shots. It was incredible.\" Wawrinka, who will play his first French Open quarter final on Wednesday, spent much of the third set ranting after arguing with the umpire and asking him to replace a linesman but said there had been some great tennis midway through the fourth set .\"We played some incredible shots,\" he said.\"I was still OK (after three and a half hours, still feeling good even though a bit slower.\"France are now 3 0 down against Switzerland at this year's French Open after Roger Federer survived a major fright to beat Gilles Simon in five sets on Sunday, having eliminated Julien Benneteau in the third round. Tension was high on Court Suzanne Lenglen as Gasquet, once dubbed the 'Mozart of tennis' saw off seven break points in his first two service games but held firm until the tiebreak, which he won 7 5 when Wawrinka sent a backhand return into the net. Wawrinka, who won the Estoril claycourt tournament and reached the Madrid Masters final this year, called on the trainer at the changeover while trailing 3 0 in the second set and had his right thigh massaged. Gasquet won the set but conceded a break, and perhaps some hope, to Wawrinka, although the Swiss appeared to let it slip when he lost his composure over a few close line calls.The world number 10 fought back after calling on the umpire to replace a linesman after the third game of the third set.\"The ball's there and he says nothing, he says nothing. Replace him at the next changeover,\" said Wawrinka .After the fifth game, Wawrinka shouted at the umpire again as a tournament official came on to the court \"Can you come please? I want to change the guy. How can he say fault?\"I want the next changeover to change. He cannot do that. That's not a small mistake, that's a big, big (mistake.\" Gasquet sought to calm down his opponent, urging him to \"take it easy. Wawrinka continued to fume throughout the third set, which he won with a forehand winner and took the fourth after some poor drop shots from Gasquet, who had just gone past his point of no return.\"I can't anymore, I can't,\" Gasquet said before the fifth set started, his face a mask of pain.The Frenchman managed to stay in the contest thanks to sheer talent but Wawrinka eventually nailed it after saving two break points in the 10th game."}
{"_id": 21, "text": "It was in California in the midst of a promising but not yet fully realized season that Jelena Jankovic had a heart to heart talk with her backhand down the line. Jankovic, the Serbian tennis star, who was ranked No.1 in the world in, was trying to furnish her new house near San Diego and was having difficulty digesting the price of the window treatment she wanted to purchase.\"I always have joked that my backhand down the line was the shot that paid my bills,\" Jankovic said. \"And I was like, this thing has to start working again, otherwise I can't get my curtains and buy some new sofas and finish my house.\"The backhand and everything else have worked well enough for Jankovic, 28, to make an unexpected return to the game's elite.After slipping to 22 in the world rankings at the end of last season, she was still heading in the wrong direction early this year.\"I was almost going to drop out of the top 30 at some point in February,\" she recalled.But after hiring her older brother Marko, 34, as her coach and winning a title later that month on clay in Bogot, she shifted the momentum. Now, after a run to the final at the top tier event in Beijing this month where she lost in straight sets to Serena Williams she is back at No.8 and back, after a two year absence, in the eight player field for the W.T.A. Tour Championships that begins on Tuesday in Istanbul.\"If I'm honest, I would not think she can finish in the championships,\" said Petra Kvitova, the Czech player who also has qualified and who lost to Jankovic in Beijing . \"But she's a former No.1, so we always know she's a great player. That happens in tennis it's a lot of ups and downs . She has a great backhand down the line. She's different to other players and she's a good mover, so it's tough to finish the point. So I think she's back.\" Jankovic remains a former No.1 without a Grand Slam singles title, but, all too accustomed to answering questions about her former ranking, she says she is at peace with her place in the game and particularly content after her resurgence.\"Yes, I was No.1 in the world in the past, but I think when you look at where I've been I was outside the top 20 so I think I'm very happy and proud of myself that I was able to come back into the top and make that step forward,\" she said. \"I think a lot of players do well but once they drop they never come back.\" Jankovic attributes her fall out of the top 10 to injuries, a loss of belief and some fitness training errors, including the decision to lift weights and bulk up in a quest for power, a move that she says cost her some of her trademark speed. A fluid counter puncher who is nearly as elastic as her compatriot Novak Djokovic, she seemed to have become too defensive.\"I think it was more of a confidence thing I wasn't confident in my shots, and I didn't feel comfortable playing and made a lot of errors,\" she said. \"I wasn't too successful whatever I was doing, so I had to make changes and try to get back on track.\"She considers hiring her brother one of her best moves.\"He started playing tennis first, and I started playing tennis because of him when I was 9 and a half years old,\" she said. \"And so, you know, I always wanted to be like my brother when I was younger and to do what he did. But afterward he stopped and went to study in university.\"\"I've had a few coaches last year and the year before and did not find the right match,\" she added, \"and I think that my brother knows me best, knows my game best, knows my character and knows me as a person, what I like and don't like. And we are very close with each other. He's my blood. And I think, honestly, who's going to wish me better than my brother?\"For most of her career, Jankovic traveled with her mother, Snezana, but she said her parents were now spending more time at home together off the road in Serbia.\"Just leading a normal life,\" Jankovic said. \"It's a lot of time on the road, in the planes, in the hotel . It's not an easy lifestyle, and for me, I've got to be fair. She has to stay at home with my dad. There are other parts of the family, not only me.\""}

{"_id": 21, "text": "Two former United States Open champions, both strong willed competitors and veterans of the spotlight, carried on late into Friday night in one of the most dramatic contests of the early stages of the Open.After a day of mostly tidy business as usual, the prime time matchup of sixth seeded Juan Mart n del Potro and Lleyton Hewitt was highly anticipated, even if it did not have the current brand name figures of the sport . It was still the charismatic del Potro, the winner here in, and Hewitt, a perennial contender whose backward cap and spunkiness fans have come to adore.Their performance surpassed its billing. Hewitt, 32, from Australia, outlasted del Potro, 6 4, 5 7, 3 6, 7 6 (2), 6 1.\"It's an amazing feeling,\" Hewitt said. \"I love being out in that atmosphere, soaking up every second of it.\"From the outset, both players seemed to nestle into their comfort zones. Hewitt was serving to win the second set, ahead by, but he double faulted to bring the game back to deuce a severe miscue that cost him. Del Potro wound up winning the game and rallied to take the set, 7 5.From there, it was back and forth, neither player sustaining momentum for more than a game or even a point. Del Potro struggled with his backhand, but his powerful forehand was crisp. Hewitt, who won here 12 years ago, played like the grizzled bulldog he has become known as.\"He's a great champion and a great fighter,\" del Potro said of Hewitt. \"For the second round, it's a really difficult player.\"Two hours and 45 minutes into the match, it could not have been tighter both players had 105 points. After del Potro won the third set, he fought off two break points to hold serve and even the fourth set at. Both players wound up exchanging breaks and the set went to a tiebreaker.There, Hewitt played at his sharpest, jumping ahead, 6 0, before winning, 7 2. He committed only four unforced errors in the fifth set, and del Potro fell flat.\"I just kept fighting and putting it out there,\" Hewitt said. \"I kept coming at him the whole night. I felt like I was seeing the ball well. Felt like I played a good game plan.\"Earlier in the evening, the defending champion, Andy Murray, became the highest seed to drop a set at the Open, and for a moment it looked as if Leonardo Mayer of Argentina could push the match to its brink.But the third seeded Murray rebounded with a fourth set more typical of him, beating Mayer, 7 5, 6 1, 3 6, 6 1, at Louis Armstrong Stadium .Against the hard hitting Mayer, Murray made seven unforced errors, while Mayer was superb with his forehand and turned up the intensity of his serves, notching five aces. The match stretched well past two hours.\"I was a bit frustrated at points in the match,\" Murray said. \"I was doing quite a lot of the running for a lot of it, and wasn't getting quite as much depth on my returns . You don't feel like you're dictating the match. It can be a little frustrating.\"Top seeded Novak Djokovic needed a tiebreaker to win the first set in a, 6 2, 6 2 victory over Benjamin Becker of Germany. Djokovic admitted he had trouble adjusting to the winds and conditions early in the match, but it hardly sounded like cause for alarm.\"It was very tough,\" he said. \"It was a lot of unforced errors, very windy conditions . You couldn't really read and predict where the ball is going to go, so you have to be very alert. At the start I had difficulty with my footwork. But, you know, I won the set, and after that, it was much, much better.\"Also advancing was No. 12 seed Tommy Haas, who beat the qualifier Yen Hsun Lu, 6 3, 6 4, 7 6 (3). Haas, 35, is playing in the rare over 30 crowd, now enthusiastically joined by Li Na ."}

We're quite comfortable with it.\"Asked what precautions were being taken both on and off the course, Davis replied \"Outside the ropes... we have done a lot to try to make muddy areas more passable, so that will continue.\"In some places we've even had to put down rock roads, certainly in parking lots where we're not on (tar) macadam.\"Inside the ropes it really is just trying to anticipate what you might get. If that means rebuilding bunkers, if that means pumping, that all goes into it.\" The biggest concern for organizers after Monday's torrential downpours at Merion was the green and greenside bunker at the 11th hole, the lowest point on the course, and Davis said pin positions for the opening round had been meticulously planned.\"Our hole locations for round one, we thought through every single one of them and said, 'Not only do we need to be mindful of the wind we might get, but we need to be mindful of where we might get puddling',\" Davis added.\"But this course drains beautifully.

On the other side of the draw, Paul Runyan met little resistance on his way to the championship match at Shawnee Country Club except for going extra holes to beat Lloyd Mangrum. Runyan faced rising star Sam Snead in the 36 hole final, pitting the enormous power of Snead against the great short game of Runyan, whose nickname was \"Little Poison.\" It was no contest. Runyan halved the fifth hole despite being stymied, using a niblick to chip in from 3 feet over Snead's ball.

Jack Nicklaus recovered quickly from finishing one shot behind at Royal Lytham St . Annes.

Nick Faldo beat him at Muirfield in 1987 by making 18 pars. Jeff Sluman took him down in the 1988 PGA Championship at Oak Hill with what might be one of the most underrated closing rounds in the majors . Sluman effectively made up a three shot deficit in one hole. He holed out with a wedge from 115 yards on the par 5 fifth hole, while Azinger a few groups later took a bogey. Sluman kept right on going until he had a 7 under, the low score of the final round, to beat Azinger by three shots. It was his first PGA Tour title, making Sluman the first player since Jerry Pate in 1976 to make a major his first tour victory.20 years ago The PGA Championship returned to Inverness, and more major heartache returned for Greg Norman .

Norman left his putt about 4 feet short, and after Azinger missed, Norman's par putt to extend the playoff lipped out. Azinger had his first major. Norman became the first player to lose all four stroke play majors in a playoff. Azinger was diagnosed with lymphoma a few months later.10 years ago Shaun Micheel was No. 169 in the world, and he was winless in 163 starts on the PGA Tour .

Having won the British Open a month earlier at Royal Birkdale, he became the first European in 78 years to win the PGA Championship, and the first European to win back to back majors in the same season."}
{"_id": 22, "text": "PARKER, Colo. Of all the autographs Paula Creamer signed at the Solheim Cup for young girls, this was by far the strangest request.It came from a 17 year old who had just steamrolled her.Charley Hull, fun and fearless over three days at Colorado Golf Club, put the finishing touch on a tone setting match by driving the green with a 3 wood on the 291 yard 14th hole for a 5 and 4 victory. It was the shortest match all week, and the first point Sunday for Europe in what became a record rout over the Americans.That's when Hull approached Creamer with a golf ball, a marker and a favor for a friend back home in England.\"Honestly, it was for my friend.\" Hull said. \"He's like, 'Can you please get Paula Creamer's autograph?' And I said, 'OK, then,' so... I just like, I got it.\"Once the laughter subsided, Hull looked straight ahead, oblivious to the moment, and said, \"But anyway, it's been a really good week.\"It was a spectacular week for Europe, which brought six Solheim Cup rookies to the mile high air outside Denver and left a strong American team out of breath.\"That was my concern, that with such a young team, with nothing to lose, it just seemed like they were a little bit looser,\" U.S. captain Meg Mallon said. \"They were making more putts, and we were not. And that's what it came down to.\"The Europeans seized control by sweeping the Saturday afternoon fourballs, with five rookies among eight players in the lineup. That gave them a 10 5 lead, and no team from any professional cup competition has ever lost from that position. Europe never let up, and the 18 10 margin was the largest since the Solheim Cup began in.On its seventh try, Europe won the Solheim Cup for the first time on American soil. It was the perfect gift to captain Liselotte Neumann, who 25 years ago became the first Swede to win a major in the U.S. Women's Open .Her best move was using two of her four captain's picks on Hull and Jodi Ewart Shadoff of England, a rookie partnership that led off the Saturday afternoon sweep by winning the most dynamic match of the week, 2 up over Creamer and 18 year old Lexi Thompson.\"She has a special game and she brings a lot of energy to our team, and she's just a terrific player,\" Neumann said of Hull. \"She plays fearless, and it was just awesome to have her on our team. We all love Charley.\"In a battle of teens, Hull and Thompson traded birdies throughout the day until Hull hit 9 iron just over the edge of the bunker to 4 feet for birdie on the par 3 17th for a 1 up lead. Ewart Shadoff finished it off by blasting a driver some 30 yards past Thompson, setting up a 9 iron to 10 feet for a conceded birdie.Caroline Hedwall, the 24 year old Swede who played at Oklahoma State, was the star of this European team. She asked Neumann to play every match, and then earned her spot in Solheim Cup history as the only player to win all five. Her birdie on the 18th to beat Michelle Wie assured that Europe would retain the cup.Carlota Ciganda of Spain, who couldn't break 80 on her own ball in her debut Friday afternoon, was unstoppable the rest of the way and won three points. Catriona Matthew, the 43 year old Scot, made the winning putt for Europe for the second time in 10 years.Hull, however, seemed to be in the middle of everything.She only turned pro in February, and while she hasn't won on the Ladies European Tour, Hull had five runner up finishes to get everyone's attention. She throws all her energy into every swing, with a corkscrew finish and then body language that leans left or right, whichever way she needs the golf ball to go. On one swing, the shaft of her driver got tangled up in her blonde ponytail.\"I didn't really feel that nervous, to be honest,\" Hull said. \"Because this is how I always look at golf . I'm not going to die if I miss it. Just hit it, and find it, and hit it again.\"Creamer could relate. She was 19 when she made her Solheim Cup debut. Creamer's personality is brasher, and she said in the weeks leading up to the 2005 Solheim Cup that Europe should prepare to get beaten. The American teen won her singles match, 7 and, against Laura Davies.Hull was so refreshing that even the ultra intense Creamer couldn't help but smile when the teen knocked in a 45 foot birdie putt on the sixth hole that gave Hull the lead for good. As for that autograph request? That was more surreal.\"Charley, she was... that was... I don't know,\" Creamer said, trying to contain laughter. \"I'm going to take it as one of the highlights of my career right there. ... And that's cool. But Charley is going to be around for a long time, and it's pretty neat to see the future of their team. She was a good player and she presented her country very well.\"As for the Americans? Mallon attributed the outcome to putting, which is the case in most every cup competition, and was the case at Colorado Golf Club . Despite the record margin of victory for Europe, 21 of the 28 matches reached the 17th hole.The Americans now have lost back to back for the first time, and have to wait two more years to try to win it back in Germany. Hull most certainly will be waiting for them, by then beyond the stage of asking for autographs."}
{"_id": 22, "text": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. Rory McIlroy's 2013 PGA Tour finale was a microcosm of his year. In defense of his title at the BMW Championship, McIlroy opened with his worst 36 hole score of the season and closed with his first back to back rounds under.McIlroy's Sunday round at Conway Farms Golf Club, his second straight, was forged in sweater and galoshes weather . He played in showers that grew heavy toward the end of his round. The rain led to two lengthy suspensions and set up a Monday finish after only six players completed their rounds and the leaders did not tee off before play was called for the day in the late afternoon . McIlroy and his playing partner, Kevin Chappell, were on the 18th hole when play was suspended for the first time because of water pooling on the course. McIlroy and Chappell had the option of finishing the hole. With the rain pounding, McIlroy rebounded from an errant drive to salvage a par and finish at seven over, not nearly good enough to qualify him for the 30 man Tour Championship beginning this week in Atlanta .Instead of being one of the weekend's best players, McIlroy settled for being among the fastest. He played Saturday's round in 2 hours 35 minutes, and on Sunday, he and Chappell finished in 40.It was not lost on McIlroy that when the pressure was on, he opened with scores of 78 and, and when he had nothing left to play for but pride and did not pause much to think he performed closer to the level he expects of himself.\"You're going out there with no real goal,\" he said. \"You're just trying to get in quick. You're just trying to play fast, and you end up shooting a decent score. So maybe it is a case of I'm maybe just trying a bit too hard out there and not just letting it all sort of go.\" McIlroy had a similar epiphany outside Miami in March when he rallied to make his first cut of the year and then closed with what ended up being his second lowest round of the year on the tour, a, to finish tied for eighth. It was one of five top 10 finishes he posted in 16 starts.If it has been hard for the 24 year old McIlroy to play as if he has nothing to lose, it is understandable. He started the year trying to maintain his grasp on the No. 1 world ranking while getting the feel for a new set of clubs. Since January, he has let go his management team and dropped to fourth in the global rankings.In, when McIlroy sat atop the money rankings and earned player of the year honors, he shot four rounds in the 60s in three of his four tour wins. With his back to back 68s at Conway Farms, McIlroy left with something to build on when he resumes play overseas after a four week break.\"I'm hitting it really well, and I'm hitting it long as well,\" said McIlroy, whose drive Saturday on the par 4 18th measured 346 yards, setting up the first of two eagles he carded for the week.\"Tee to green, I'm there,\" he said. \"My stats would suggest I'm as good if not a little better than last year.\"Where he is stubbing his toe is with his wedges and putter, as he showed when he landed in a greenside bunker on his second shot on the par 4 13th on Saturday and walked off the green with a double bogey .\"I've always thought of myself as a really good bunker player, and this year, it just hasn't been up to the same standard,\" McIlroy said. \"This week, I worked on it. That's a part of the game that I've got to work on a lot.\"He added, \"That's the one area of the game I feel if I can get it back to the level I know it can be at, I'll be contending for tournament titles again and I'll be back at the level where I'm contending to win golf tournaments week in and week out.\"On Sunday, McIlroy extended his streak of rounds with a double bogey to seven. He has not gone an entire week without carding a double bogey since the Players Championship in May. He has not had a bogey free round since his 66 in the first round at T.P.C. Sawgrass on May.\"A round isn't complete without a double bogey these days,\" McIlroy said Saturday with a laugh.Sixteen winless weeks this year on the tour, and McIlroy has not lost his sense of humor . That may be the best indicator that he will be back in the victory circle in."}
{"_id": 22, "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. In golf, and almost no other sport, interactive, real time communication between armchair television viewers and referees supervising the competition routinely changes rulings and alters the outcomes of tournaments . This collaboration of living room second guessers and rules officials is an almost weekly occurrence. On Saturday, it embroiled the Masters, golf's biggest event, in a controversy that involved the game's most celebrated player, Tiger Woods . Woods, who had been three strokes off the lead, was assessed a two stroke penalty Saturday for hitting from the wrong spot on Friday, a violation first flagged by a television viewer. Woods could have been disqualified from the Masters, but officials instead invoked a rarely applied two year old rule that spares offending players in exceptional cases.The catalyst for the rules controversy began with a short and simple text message .A friend of a rules official saw something on television that looked improper, an illegal drop by Woods after his ball plunked into a pond at the 15th hole. Masters officials would not reveal the identity of the texter, but the claim was brought before the Masters rules committee, which decided there was no violation. Then, about an hour later, Woods inadvertently implicated himself, saying that before dropping the ball he had taken two steps back, which was not permitted under the circumstances.The process for Saturday's ruling might have been especially delicate removing Woods from the Masters could have ruined TV ratings and deprived the world's top ranked player of his best chance in several years to win his 15th major championship .But Masters officials said neither Woods's popularity nor his pursuit of history was a factor. They had absolved him of wrongdoing on Friday a day later, they said they could not impose the harsh penalty that goes with signing an incorrect scorecard disqualification because their earlier decision mitigated his culpability.Unheard of in other sports, communication between viewers and tournament officials happens nearly every week on the professional golf tours.At the Masters, officials said hundreds of viewers contacted the club with suspected rules infractions. Most often, they call the club, whose phone number is easy to find on the Internet .\"There are a lot of people out there that know a lot about the rules, or think they know a lot about the rules,\" said Fred Ridley, the Masters chairman for competition committees . \"It creates more work for us, but we do look at every one of these.\"The defending Masters champion, Bubba Watson, said Saturday that PGA Tour players were approached about viewer generated rules investigations so frequently it was shrugged off in the players' locker room .\"Our sport is the only one you'd ever allow viewers to do that,\" Watson said. \"They're definitely not calling about missed balls and strikes during a baseball game or if someone's getting away with holding during a football game.\"Asked why it happens in golf, Watson answered, \"Maybe it's because our sport is so slow, people have time to call.\" Television viewers also routinely have more than one phone number to call. Many try contacting the network broadcasting the event. Many go directly to the United States Golf Association because it oversees the rules of golf in this country. And others contact the PGA Tour itself, whose phone number is easily found.\"They must have a lot of time on their hands,\" Watson said. \"Because I don't know the phone number to call, and I'm playing in the golf tournament .\"At Augusta National Golf Club, which hosts the Masters, any rules infraction phone call coming through the main switchboard is sent to the tournament headquarters office.The details of the call are recorded and documented with the specifics of the suspected violation scrupulously noted and then passed on to the Masters rules committee . Each case is investigated, which can involve interviewing the player or players involved, until the situation is resolved as groundless or worthy of a penalty. \"The players are under a microscope, and people watch their golf closely,\" Ridley said. \"And when they contact us, we make a determination.\"The history of television whistle blowers in golf goes back at least 25 years. At the 1987 San Diego Open, Craig Stadler, a Masters winner, was in contention during the third round when he knelt on a towel to hit a shot from under a tree on the 14th hole.He was trying to keep his pants clean, but multiple viewers phoned the tournament press room to report he had illegally \"built a stance,\" to use the terminology in golf's rule book. Stadler was not informed about the rules accusations until Sunday, after he had posted a score that would have been good for third place. Instead, he was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after the Saturday round.Through the years, various infractions have been noticed by viewers golfers illegally removing impediments, touching their clubs in the sand of bunkers or accidentally hitting a competitor's ball instead of their own.Other major sports do not have a system in place that would allow viewers at home to contact the ruling authorities and point out overlooked transgressions.But in golf, which is largely policed by players who routinely call penalties on themselves, the interloping armchair referee is welcomed, or at least listened to. Looking the other way when a rule is breached would be considered offensive to the game's integrity, as well as the sense that golf is governed by an unseen karma known as the rub of the green.A case in point might have occurred last month at the L.P.G.A. event in Scottsdale, Ariz. Stacy Lewis was assessed a two stroke penalty after a television viewer spotted her caddie testing the surface of a bunker in the third round. Lewis was approached about the possible infraction before signing her scorecard. After watching a replay, she signed for a 68 instead of a.During the next day's final round, Lewis overcame a four stroke deficit to win the tournament and was crowned the world's No. 1 ranked player."}
{"_id": 22, "text": "GULLANE, Scotland When Lee Westwood holed his sixth birdie of the day on Muirfield's 12th hole on Friday before racking up three bogeys over the closing six it was tempting to suggest it would be the same old story for the Englishman .Westwood, 40, has so often tantalised his fans with thoughts of a first major title only to fade away that the believers are dwindling with each passing attempt. An awful lot must still go Westwood's way this weekend if he is to win but there was a swagger about him that bodes well for his chances.Renowned for being one of the best ball strikers in the world, Westwood's putting has often proved his Achilles heel at the sharp end of the majors .That was not the case, however, on Friday as he put together a superb three under 68 to move two under for the championship .Westwood's putter was on fire during the opening dozen holes and despite the late dropped shots he produced some gutsy par saving \"momentum putts\" to keep himself in the mix.\"There's not many majors you turn up where it's a birdie fest and you make a bogey and you feel like you're losing getting lapped by the field,\" said Westwood, who has been working with putting coach and 1991 Open winner Ian Baker Finch.\"It's just a case of not following a bogey with another three bogeys in major championships, limiting the damage and picking up birdies whenever you can.\"A prime example of that was at the par five 17th where he was desperately unlucky to see a superb tee shot just trickle into the rough and after hacking out and reaching the green in three he left himself a nasty 10 footer for par.To huge roars from the packed stands he holed it and although he did drop a shot on the treacherous 18th green he was still upbeat about his form.\"I felt if I came out and shot level par, I thought one over would be right in contention. To be two under is a real bonus, it could be leading at the end of the day, you never know,\" Westwood, who was looking forward to watching the late starters on a drying course, told reporters .\"I'm hitting the ball well. Controlling the flight most of the time pretty well and getting up and down when I need to.\"I always seem to putt the greens well. But I got a couple of tips on getting tension out of my arms and having a bit more control. And I'm getting it on line nicely, and I've gauged the pace of the greens as well.\"Westwood is playing in his 62nd major and 19th consecutive British Open . He finished runner up in 2010 at St Andrews and the previous year he was tied for third.Usually, however, he has struggled to hold it all together for four rounds.With the sunshine scorching Muirfield's fairways and making the greens so slippery, the list of players equipped with the tools to tame it is shrinking rapidly.\"I think this probably takes more experience, especially when it gets like this,\" Westwood said.\"There won't be many people who have played Open championships or links courses very often in these conditions. Certainly experience is a big factor.\"Westwood's confident gait was noted by playing partner Charl Schwartzel, who matched the Englishman's.\"Around this sort of golf course those par putts are birdie putts on other tournaments,\" Schwartzel told reporters . \"He's done that and that's definitely kept him up in his confidence.\"You can see the way he's walking and the way he's playing. Definitely a dangerman,\" the South African added. \"I thought he putted beautifully.\""}
{"_id": 22, "text": "GULLANE, Scotland Lee Westwood was addressing a birdie putt on the ninth green when a child starting crying in the packed stand just behind him.It seemed as if everyone on and around the putting surface looked up, or squirmed.The Englishman didn't even flinch, staying in his zone as he rolled in the fifth birdie of his second round en route to briefly taking a share of the lead at the British Open on Friday.Westwood's woes on the greens have been the main reason why he remains without a major at the age of. But moving to the United States this year and hiring 1991 Open champion Ian Baker Finch as his putting coach has helped.His putting on Muirfield's bone dry greens was sharp as he shot a 3 under 68 that left him at 2 under and right in contention at yet another major championship . He was tied for second, a stroke behind Miguel Angel Jimenez .\"I got a couple of tips from Ian on getting tension out of my arms and having a bit more control,\" Westwood said. \"And I'm getting it on line nicely, and I've gauged the pace of the greens as well.\"While the front nine was about picking up shots to close the gap on overnight leader Zach Johnson, the back nine was simply about holding on as the holes became longer and tougher and the fairways and greens turned even crustier. Charl Schwartzel, Westwood's playing partner, said the fairways were like \"runways\" his drive on No. 15 sped into a bunker at 380 yards and said playing conditions were \"not exactly fair.\"After joining Johnson at 5 under with a 4 foot birdie putt on No. 12, taking him to 6 under for the round, Westwood made bogeys at the next two holes and then another at No. 18.But he made clutch putts at Nos. 14, 16 and 17 where Tiger Woods' girlfriend, Lindsey Vonn, was watching that kept the momentum going.In a sight rarely seen in sport around here, Scots were roaring on an Englishman .\"I thought he putted beautifully, the putts that he needed to make he has made,\" Schwartzel said. \"And then that's been the difference with him this week so far.\"You can see the way he's walking and the way he's playing. Definitely a dangerman.\"That's nothing new for Westwood at majors but he just can't finish them off.He three putted his 72nd hole at Turnberry in 2009 to miss out on a playoff with Tom Watson and Stewart Cink by a stroke.\"I felt really sick about it for a couple of days,\" Westwood recalled of the most distressing of his eight top five finishes in majors .Westwood has long been one of the best players in the world from tee to green, but his short game has let him down. Since his move to the U.S., his putting and chipping have improved to such an extent that he is ranked fourth on the PGA Tour in scrambling from less than 30 yards .And his sessions with Baker Finch, an Australian and close neighbor in Palm Beach Gardens who won the Open at Birkdale, have led to a marked change to his mentality on the greens.Westwood couldn't be happier with his overall game right now.\"I'm hitting the ball well. And controlling the flight most of the time pretty well, and getting up and down when I needed to,\" he said. \"I've always enjoyed playing Muirfield and felt like it suited my game.\"Westwood is looking to become the first Englishman to win his national Open since Nick Faldo in.If he does so on Sunday, he will have an Aussie to thank."}
{"_id": 22, "text": "ARDMORE, Pennsylvania Luke Donald, who surged into the U.S. Open lead just as first round play was suspended on Thursday, slipped out of it after completing the difficult finishing holes at Merion Golf Club on Friday.Bogeys at the par four 16th and the par four last gave the Englishman a round of two under par, one stroke behind first round clubhouse leader Phil Mickelson .World number six Donald, seeking his first major title, leapfrogged Mickelson into the lead when he posted his third straight birdie of the weather interrupted round on the par three 13th hole to reach four under par just before play was suspended due to failing light.Returning for a 15 a.m. start, Donald encountered different conditions and more difficult holes on a chilly morning at Merion with intermittent rain .\"A complete switch in wind and obviously a big drop in temperature,\" the former world number one said. \"So those holes are playing long.\"Donald, who once had an impressive streak of 449 successive holes in competition without a three putt, was surprisingly undermined by his putter.The 35 year old Briton three putted the 16th hole and the 18th.\"Misreads,\" said Donald, a winner of five PGA Tour events and seven titles on the European circuit.\"Certainly those last five holes are very, very tough.\"Donald said despite softened conditions following torrential rains in the last week, the relatively short Merion layout remained a stern test.\"I think everyone thought that as soon as the course got wet it was going to play easy,\" said Donald. \"The scores certainly aren't showing that.\"The tough holes are extremely tough. It does give you a little bit of balance with some of those shorter holes, but you really need to play those tough ones well.\"Donald only had about 90 minutes to recoup after heading off to begin his second round.\"I got no choice. Grab something quick to eat, hit a few balls and get out there,\" he said. \"I think it's good to have a good turn around, I'll still be warm.\""}
{"_id": 22, "text": "ST . ANDREWS, Scotland Mickey Wright can appreciate Inbee Park's pursuit of a fourth straight major this year at the Women's British Open .She just can't relate to all the attention over a potential Grand Slam .\"One big difference in golf now and then and this was well before Title IX is women's golf did not get a lot of hoopla,\" the 78 year old Wright told The Associated Press from her Florida home Wednesday. \"There was not a lot of hoopla around winning four majors at the same time. I didn't have that kind of pressure. It was internal pressure.\"Park begins her bid Thursday at St . Andrews to become the first golfer to win four professional majors in the same season.Wright is the only LPGA Tour player to hold all four majors at the same time, which she achieved over two seasons the U.S. Women's Open and LPGA Championship in, and the Titleholders and Western Open in. Her bid for the calendar Grand Slam in '62 ended on a tough course and high wind in Myrtle Beach, S.C. at the Women's Open .Her record makes a strong argument as the greatest female golfer ever 13 majors over an eight year span and 82 career wins on the LPGA.She would love to see Park join her and Tiger Woods in the record book. Woods also held all four professional majors over two seasons in.\"I watch her when they put her on television,\" Wright said. \"She certainly is an unflappable young lady. She's probably the best putter I've ever seen. And I've seen some good ones. I'm hoping she can pull it off, and then win the fifth one in France. No one will ever come close to that unless the LPGA adds a sixth major.\"The LPGA, which doesn't have the history or the financial support of men's golf, added the Evian Championship in France as a fifth major this year. That has led to some debate whether Park will have the Grand Slam if she wins at St . Andrews because one more major remains in September.\"What she has already done is absolutely fantastic,\" Wright said. \"I know she'd be satisfied even if she doesn't win this week. I just hope people leave her alone.\"That's one aspect Wright knows all too well.Wright, who had a swing Ben Hogan once said was the best he ever saw, carried the LPGA Tour in its early days and was under intense pressure to play and win to appease sponsors. She won 68 tournaments in the 1960s, including 44 events in a four year span. For seven straight years, she won at least one major, including the four straight in 1961 62 and her attempt at a calendar Grand Slam stopped short in.\"There was no talk about a Grand Slam,\" Wright said. \"We were trying to exist. It was a different time. You have to remember, we were the pioneers. We were trying to keep the tour going.\"What impresses Wright the most about Park is her calm demeanor and her putting stroke, considered among the best in women's golf . What amazes her is that Park is winning all the majors even though she doesn't overpower golf courses with length or overwhelm the competition with superior ball striking . The 25 year old South Korean doesn't have a presence that Annika Sorenstam had during her great run, or Nancy Lopez in the 1970s, or that Wright had for nearly all of her career.\"She has yet to prove that presence and that takes time,\" Wright said. \"This is a phenomenal year, not a career.\""}
{"_id": 23, "text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. The handshakes and backslaps exchanged in the Miami Dolphins' locker room late Sunday afternoon were gestures of consolation, not celebration, before players quietly slipped out the back door at the end of another disappointing season . Miami was eliminated from the scramble for the AFC's final wild card berth by the New York Jets, who thrived in the role of spoilers against their archrivals and won. The Dolphins blew an early lead to complete a December collapse that will keep them out of the playoffs for a fifth straight year.\"It's definitely going to take a little while to get over this one,\" quarterback Ryan Tannehill said.New York's Geno Smith led three long scoring drives, ran for a touchdown and threw for 190 yards, while two interceptions by rookie Dee Milliner and one by 35 year old Ed Reed prevented a Miami comeback.The Dolphins (8 8) squandered a shot at their first postseason berth since 2008 by losing the final two games to non playoff teams, including a shutout defeat at last place Buffalo . It was a dismal end to a roller coaster season that included a four game losing streak, a bullying scandal that drew national scrutiny, and a December surge that briefly left the Dolphins in control of their playoff destiny but turned out to be a tease.\"Our record is, and that's the definition of average,\" cornerback Brent Grimes said. \"We felt like we could be a much better than average team, so we're disappointed. We messed up in the last two games. We've just got to live with that.\"The Dolphins were outscored 39 7 in those final two games. Now owner Stephen Ross must decide whether to shake up a regime led by second year coach Joe Philbin and sixth year general manager Jeff Ireland.\"You have to earn your way into the playoffs. Clearly we didn't do that,\" Philbin said. \"The results start with me. The head coach is responsible for the results. The offense, the defense, the special teams, the record it starts with me. Let's not stand here and blame the players.\"The Jets (8 8) celebrated as though they're playoff bound but will sit out the postseason for the third year in a row. After the game, owner Woody Johnson announced that coach Rex Ryan would return for a sixth season in.Ryan, whose future had been in question, said Johnson gave him the news before the game. When players were told afterward, they cheered in the locker room .\"I'll say this I love being the head coach of the New York Jets, plain and simple,\" Ryan said. \"You put everything you've got into it. I never wanted to go out this way. We've missed the playoffs three straight years, and that bothers me, no question.\"The Jets made sure they were joined on the postseason sideline by Miami . The only points of the season's final two weeks for the Dolphins put them ahead 7 0 in the second quarter, but the Jets rallied by mounting touchdown drives of 71 and 80 yards on their final possessions of the first half.When Smith scored on a 7 yard, third down keeper up the middle with 3 seconds left for a 14 7 lead at halftime, an excited Ryan ran on the field to celebrate with his players.Fans were booing in the first half and streaming for the exits in the final minutes . Smith drove the Jets 63 yards to set up a field goal that gave them a 17 7 cushion with 18 left, and on the next play Reed grabbed a deflected pass for his 64th career interception to all but seal the victory . Milliner stopped a Miami threat in the third quarter with a diving interception of Tannehill one play after Mike Wallace dropped a potential touchdown pass that would have tied the game .The Jets played like a team with nothing to lose, which they were, and eager to spoil Miami's season. They kept the Dolphins off balance with swarming defense and imaginative play calling, including 294 pound defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson's 1 yard plunge for his second rushing touchdown this season. Running back Bilal Powell threw a 30 yard completion to set up the Jets' field goal . Dolphins receiver Brian Hartline left the game in the first quarter with a left knee injury, while Wallace and Tannehill found it difficult to click all day. Tannehill overthrew an open Wallace deep, and Wallace slipped and fell on Milliner's first interception.They did combine for a 5 yard touchdown to cap an 89 yard drive . But the Dolphins' running game sputtered, as usual, and Tannehill finished with a woeful passer rating of.1.\"It can't get worse than this,\" Wallace said. \"We let them win. We let them dominate the game. We knew what we had on the line, and we didn't come up with the plays we needed.\"Notes Hartline limped out of the game after a 25 yard reception that put him over the,000 yard mark for the second year in a row. ... Jets reserve CB Kyle Wilson left in the first half with a knee injury and didn't return. ... Before the game, former LB DE Kim Bokamper, WR O.J. McDuffie, RB Mercury Morris and G Keith Sims were inducted into the Dolphins' Walk of Fame."}

At halftime of Week 2 of what could be his farewell season as coach of the Jets, Rex Ryan benched a first round draft pick, Dee Milliner, the Alabama cornerback who was brought in to replace the irreplaceable Darrelle Revis .\"The young man is going to be a great player,\" Ryan explained after the Jets lost to the New England Patriots, 13 10, Thursday night . \"But I went with the veteran.\"He no doubt wishes he also had that option at quarterback . He doesn't, because Mark Sanchez is injured. And he shouldn't, because if the Jets do nothing else during this transitional season, they must decide if Geno Smith can be their long term answer at their most important position.The early projections on Smith are could be, perhaps, we'll see, hard to say. As Ryan said, recapping the situation after three fourth quarter interceptions of Smith in the rain sealed the Jets' first defeat of the season, \"The young man had his moments.\"That he did. But so did Milliner, and they did not spare him the hook for a few mistakes that included being beaten in the end zone by the Patriots' Kenbrell Thompkins for a stretched out touchdown that was nullified by replay.\"Sometimes it's the best thing for you,\" Ryan said of Milliner's having to watch Kyle Wilson and Darrin Walls help Ryan's encouragingly robust defense shut out Tom Brady and the Patriots in the second half.But was the benching of Milliner purely a spontaneous, intuitive decision by Ryan, or was it also a subliminal exertion of control by a once untouchable coach who is now on the short leash of the first year general manager John Idzik ?Idzik is also heavily invested in Milliner, perhaps even more so than in Smith, a second round draft choice . And a strong case could be made that Ryan is too emotional to be so transparently Machiavellian. But these are the questions that will inevitably be asked when the owner, Woody Johnson, disregards standard operational protocol and does not allow his principal executive to choose his own coach from the start.For four eventful years, Ryan could come across as charmingly bombastic or let's face it as kind of a quack. Now much of what he says sounds like the quacking of a lame duck . His postgame news conference mixed expressions of resignation \"I don't know what to tell you\" and \"I don't know what to say, so I'll take questions\" with embraces of harsh reality.\"All that matters is wins and losses,\" he said when asked if narrowly losing to the (albeit battered) Patriots on the road with a rookie quarterback represented a moral victory. \"Shoot, I'm paid to win.\"For the time being, Idzik has a more transformative calling. He is being paid to guide the franchise into the post Sanchez era, even as Sanchez assumes the role of the martyred quarterback and wishfully contends he is still a part of the equation.Interviewed by Rich Eisen of the NFL Network before the game, Sanchez said he had forgone surgery to repair what has been reported to be a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder with the intention of returning to the lineup this season.\"What I'm really disappointed about is that I got hurt, because I won the competition,\" Sanchez said, referring to the training camp battle between him and Smith. \"There's no doubt. It was a done deal.\"If it was, it was Ryan (who predictably denied it) and Sanchez's deal not Idzik's, and not the deal that was in the best interests of the franchise . Not to suggest that Idzik would celebrate an injury to Sanchez, but the typically Jets wacky sequence of events that installed Smith as the starter could not have worked out better in the grand scheme of things.But not so much for Ryan, who never mind Idzik might have a fan insurrection on his hands if he tries to do with Smith and Sanchez what he did Thursday night with Milliner and Wilson Walls.The odds of Ryan returning in 2014 have to be the rough equivalent of his team's making the playoffs and that would mean making the most of any legitimate opportunity to steal a victory. Had Sanchez been healthy, he might have fared better than Smith in the fourth quarter, when Smith threw all three picks.But the Jets have been there and done that with Sanchez. In Smith they may not yet trust, but they surely do hope. So, he lost the first road game of his career, in the rain, to Bill Belichick and Brady what a news break.He did, conversely, throw for more yards than Brady, 214 to. He did engineer a beautiful 9 play, 58 yard, 5 minute drive in a third quarter downpour .\"You saw him play with poise and show what he's capable of if we all execute,\" said Bilal Powell, who scored the touchdown on a 3 yard run .We also saw several passes dropped, and Stephen Hill had one knocked from his grasp after a terrific 33 yard hookup with Smith.If we do not have a measure yet on Smith's future, we do know he can throw and run. But he can and will make poor reads, miss open receivers, hold on to the ball too long or throw it away when he might still make something happen with his legs.\"We encourage him all the time to be aggressive,\" Powell said. \"But with that comes mistakes.\"Those of the past cannot be undone, and the Sanchez era has been deemed one. It was not his fault alone, and you can certainly sympathize with him for the Jet brand of incompetence that got him hurt in the fourth quarter of a meaningless preseason game .That said, it was the same organizational incompetence that put about 20 million in Sanchez's pocket for last season and this season, which he hardly deserved.Call it a draw, and on with the show. That includes Dee Milliner as well."}
{"_id": 23, "text": "NASHVILLE All that is new and supposedly improved about the Jets this season the starting quarterback, the offensive philosophy, Rex Ryan's coaching staff was viewed at LP Field on Sunday with a fair amount of skepticism the theme music to \"The Benny Hill Show\" accompanied their pregame stampede out of the tunnel.That is how fans here remember the Jets a bumbling, blundering outfit whose dysfunction and ineptitude converged in a blooper filled debacle last December and, to be fair, their perception is not without merit.Instead of summoning a victory that would establish their credibility and validate their early season optimism, the Jets stumbled to a 38 13 loss to the Tennessee Titans, a defeat that, like last year's, was defined by the struggles of their quarterback .It was Geno Smith, not Mark Sanchez, who committed turnover after turnover, four in all, three in the first half and none that could be justified by a reasonable explanation. There were two fumbles and two interceptions, and the Titans scored a touchdown after every one. The Jets trailed by 10 points after the first quarter, 18 at halftime and, the final margin, for much of the fourth.\"I never expected for the game to turn out like this,\" Ryan said, and his wrath afterward spared no one.Not a defense that conceded four passing touchdowns and a 56 percent success rate on third down. Not an offensive line that buckled under pressure that players swore they knew was coming, yielding five sacks. Not the cornerbacks, who Ryan said must learn to compete better when the ball is in the air. And certainly not Smith, who drew perhaps the harshest criticism of all.A few times, Ryan has alluded to lessons he learned from his handling four years ago of Sanchez, and one of them might be his willingness to overlook Smith's rookie status and deliver sharp, public rebukes of his performance.It happened in training camp, when Ryan described Smith's play during one error laden practice as brutal, and it happened again Sunday, when he rejected the notion that Smith's penchant for turnovers 10 in four games was a normal, if hardly desired, aspect of the development of a first year quarterback .\"How many times do we have to make that excuse, though?\" Ryan said. \"One of these days, we're going to learn from them. It better be soon.\"Soon is a nebulous ultimatum by next week? Two weeks? Three? Smith is in no imminent danger of losing his job, but he does recognize the importance of taking responsibility for his actions. He spoke to several players afterward and, according to linebacker Antwan Barnes, told them, \"It won't happen again.\"\"All I can do is put my trust in him,\" Barnes said, adding, \"He said he's got to do better, so I believe in him.\"This was considered a game the Jets could win or at least a game they had to win to prove their bona fides. All season they have teetered between agony and ecstasy, with their first three games decided by all of 11 points. Sometimes, luck and explosive plays can offset penalties and turnovers, as they did last Sunday against Buffalo, but it cannot occur every week.There were no long gains to balance Smith's lack of awareness, and there were no defensive stands to compensate for the Jets' offensive ineffectiveness. They spoke of enhanced focus, confidence and discipline after outlasting the Bills in a 20 penalty fiasco, and yet all evidence suggested the contrary. They committed 10 more penalties Sunday, with some stalling drives or negating third down conversions, and they also failed to force a turnover for the third straight week.The Jets are, in many ways, fortunate to have a record as good as 2 2 with a minus 10 turnover margin. Smith, who completed 23 of 34 passes for 289 yards and a fourth quarter touchdown to Jeff Cumberland, said he forced the throw on his first interception, which came on his first pass of the game. He called his first fumble \"reckless.\" His second fumble could be considered an adaptation of Sanchez's infamous butt fumble last year against New England that, staying true to the original, produced the same deflating result."}

The Jets fired their general manager, Mike Tannenbaum, but have maintained silence about the status of their embattled offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano. Also continuing is the search for Tannenbaum's replacement, who will inherit both a coach and a quarterback, Mark Sanchez, he might not want but will probably have little choice but to retain.The Jets have been lampooned for demonstrating a lack of accountability since Tannenbaum's dismissal. The revelation that Ryan is recharging for a few days in the Bahamas has only fed that perception.Only players available in a one hour period of locker room access Monday could speak to the chaos surrounding the team. Many did, with running back Joe McKnight saying, \"It kind of messed with us a little bit.\"By delaying Ryan's and Johnson's availability until Tuesday, the Jets are violating N.F.L. policy, which requires every team to conduct a news conference during the week after the season \"with its head coach, and or owner, and or club president and or general manager \" to \"respond to fan interest.\" None of the other 19 teams that failed to make the playoffs violated the policy, according to the N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello, who said the league was investigating the matter .THE CARDINALS' SEARCH The Arizona Cardinals have completed an extensive interview that spread over two days with their defensive coordinator, Ray Horton, in the search for a replacement for the team's fired coach, Ken Whisenhunt.Next up is Andy Reid, the longtime Philadelphia Eagles coach, who was among seven N.F.L. head coaches who were fired on Monday. Reid's interview, while not formally scheduled, could come on Thursday.Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals' president, has identified Horton, Reid and Mike McCoy, the Denver Broncos' offensive coordinator, as candidates to replace Whisenhunt, who was dismissed after six seasons.

The owners would then vote on such a change.\"We are always looking at plays that may elevate themselves and we do include in that category hits on defenseless players,\" Anderson said. \"And certainly the hits to knees to players who have not had the opportunity to protect themselves or are not looking in the direction of where the hit comes from we have had a couple hits whereby a player was hit below (or at) the knees.\"Currently, hits to the head and neck of defenseless players are outlawed. But two direct hits to the knee in preseason games that injured Miami tight end Dustin Keller and Minnesota defensive tackle Kevin Williams have drawn complaints from some players.Keller is out for the season with several torn knee ligaments. Williams has a hyperextended knee.Anderson said the league will monitor plays during the year, study the data when the competition committee begins meeting after the season and see whether such hits to the knees are an \"aberration or becoming a problem.\"\"This issue has not directly come up,\" Anderson added. \"But when we have had discussions when making the head and neck area completely off limits to players, there was some concern players might lower their targets and might include knees and below.

Canan has said that videotape evidence supported his client's claim.But the state attorney said those videos did not clearly show who was involved in the altercation.

{"_id": 23, "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. Jameis Winston quickly emerged as one of college football's biggest stars because of his brilliant play, while also charming Florida State fans with his smile and natural charisma.The 19 year old redshirt freshman seemed poised and mature beyond his years, whether he was throwing touchdown passes after shedding a defensive lineman or answering questions from reporters about what it took to be the leader of one of the best teams in the country.Three weeks ago the story changed. A year old sexual assault complaint against him was given by Tallahassee police to the state's attorney office to be investigated. For three weeks, Winston faced the possibility of serious criminal charges . He was accused of rape by a female Florida State student. His lawyer said the sex was consensual. Winston continued to play spectacularly. While he was shielded from answering direct questions about the investigation, he gave his routine interviews leading up to and after games. If the investigation was stressing him out, he wasn't showing it publicly.And according to coach Jimbo Fisher, he wasn't showing it privately either.\"He's been the same guy, and like I said, he believed in the process, and he believed in himself, and he's been the same guy,\" Fisher said Friday at a news conference at Bank of America Stadium for the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game against Duke, about 24 hours after prosecutors in Florida announced Winston would not be charged.\"It's been a remarkable maturity level presented by him to be able to compartmentalize and handle things he can control and not that anything was (taken) lightly or he didn't take it seriously, but like I say, in our life everybody has issues or something going on in your life, and the ones that can compartmentalize and function and handle them when they have to handle them are the ones that are very successful, and he's very mature like that,\" Fisher said.No. 1 Florida State played three games from the time news broke about the complaint until the time the case was closed. There were certainly no signs of distraction from the Seminoles, though this team is so talented that rolling Syracuse, Idaho and Florida by a combined 176 24 could have been accomplished with less than full attention. Winston completed 67 percent of his passes in those three games for 829 yards, with nine touchdown passes and one interception. He appeared to be the same jovial guy on the sideline, joking with teammates and interacting with fans after games.When it was time to answer the at times awkwardly worded questions about dealing with \"distractions,\" he deftly managed to swing it back toward talking about the team and the game.\"He took everything extremely seriously, but he also understood he had a responsibility as a student, as a teammate to handle himself the way he did, and it's been remarkable the way he's done it,\" Fisher said. \"I have seen no signs (of stress, and he and I talk quite often.\"Fisher said he has seen no change in his team's mood or demeanor since the decision not to charge Winston was announced.\"It's the same football team we were then,\" Fisher said. Winston and Florida State are a victory away from playing in the BCS national championship game, and are overwhelming favorites against Duke . The Heisman Trophy is also in Winston's grasp. Only some sort monumental meltdown against the Blue Devils is likely to keep Winston from collecting the bronze statue next week in New York.\"Because when it's time to play football, when it's time to go to school, he compartmentalizes and handles his responsibilities,\" Fisher said.\"I think he understands that he had a responsibility to his team, that they worked very hard, and that was his responsibility to be their quarterback and be their leader, and he handled his individual situation on his own time, his own merits, and I think he did a great job of understanding and compartmentalizing.\""}
{"_id": 23, "text": "ALLEN PARK, Mich. Jim Schwartz was hired to turn around the Detroit Lions and he did it for three seasons.He failed to keep the Lions going in the right direction the next two years and it cost him his job.The Lions fired Schwartz on Monday, one day after their late season slide ended with a loss at Minnesota . He had two years and nearly 12 million left on his contract.Schwartz informed the players of the decision during a team meeting.\"I feel awful for him,\" Lions center Dominic Raiola said. \"I feel like we let him down.\"Team President Tom Lewand said the search has begun for what he thinks is one of the most if not the most attractive opportunities for a head coach in the NFL .\"I can verify that by the number of calls we have already gotten since the announcement was made,\" Lewand said. \"Going through a thorough process is extremely important . That doesn't necessarily it has to be a long process.\" San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt is among the potential candidates . Whisenhunt led the Arizona Cardinals to the Super Bowl during a six year run as their coach and Lions general manager Martin Mayhew is a former Washington Redskins teammate.The Lions also let offensive coordinator Scott Linehan and wide receivers coach Tim Lappano seek other jobs, saying the rest of the staff is under contract, including some assistants for the 2014 season. Detroit flopped to a 7 9 record this year after a 6 3 record start put the franchise in a position to win a division title for the first time since.\"That is the reason we are sitting here having this conversation,\" Lewand said.Schwartz was 29 51 over five seasons, including a 10 6 mark in 2011 that lifted the Lions to their only postseason appearance this century. The former Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator was hired in 2009 when Detroit was coming off the NFL's first 0 16 season.Schwartz led the Lions to two wins in his first year, six the next and to double digits in victories two years ago for the first time since 1995 to help them end an 11 year postseason drought.The Lions lost their last eight games last year after a.500 start. They collapsed again this season with four straight losses and six in a seven game stretch blowing fourth quarter leads in each setback after they took control of the NFC North race. Detroit and the 2000 San Diego Chargers are the only NFL teams since 1940 to lose fourth quarter leads in seven games in a season, according to STATS.\"From where we were in 2008 to where we are now it's a big difference,\" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \"We owe a lot of that to him. He's a really smart guy and helped us get to where we are. Obviously, we didn't win as many games as we needed to or as we should have this year.\"The Lions took on the personality of their demonstrative and emotionally charged coach and that wasn't always good news for them.When Detroit ran the ball instead of having turnover prone Stafford throw late in regulation of its 23 20 overtime loss to the New York Giants in Week, the crowd reacted with a loud chorus of boos. Schwartz responded by looking away from the field and screaming something toward the stands.Schwartz negated a video review and was called for unsportsmanlike conduct by angrily throwing a challenge flag last season when Houston's Justin Forsett scored after two Lions tackled him, leading to a defeat during an eight game, season ending slide. The previous year, Schwartz had a heated exchange with San Francisco coach Jim Harbaugh and had to be separated following their postgame handshake.\"The stuff that happened with Harbaugh just was an incident,\" Detroit guard Rob Sims said. \"The stuff with the fans just was an incident. That's not an everyday occurrence.\"Schwartz was 12 32 in games in November or later for a.273 winning percentage that was the worst for a coach in five plus straight seasons with a team since Denver's Lou Saban won one quarter of those late season games from, according to STATS. His.363 winning percentage overall with the Lions is the worst by an NFL coach in his first five full seasons since John McKay won fewer than 30 percent of his games with the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers from.The Lions gave Schwartz an extension entering the 2012 season, when he had one year left on his four deal worth about 11 million .The second contract made him the longest tenured coach the franchise has had since Wayne Fontes led the Lions from.Bobby Ross, Gary Moeller, Marty Mornhinweg, Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron on an interim basis and Rod Marinelli all had a chance to lead a franchise with only one playoff victory since winning the 1957 NFL title before Schwartz got a shot to be a head coach for the first time at any level.The Lions would like to hire someone, who runs a 4 3 defense and has head coaching experience, but they're not going to overlook assistants who fit the profile they're looking for.\"The goal isn't to hire the biggest name or the most popular candidate and win the next press conference,\" Lewand said. \"It's to win football games in 2014 and to win a championship .\""}

{"_id": 24, "text": "ST . PETERSBURG, Fla. The Boston Red Sox had thoroughly dominated their American League division series with the Tampa Bay Rays, standing a victory from a sweep on Monday night at Tropicana Field. The Rays, meanwhile, were trying to avoid a third early postseason exit since their run to the World Series in.But the Rays, accustomed to the pressure of elimination games this season, delivered again, this time off the unlikely bat of Jose Lobaton . With two outs in the ninth inning of a 4 4 game, Lobaton sent a ball from Red Sox closer Koji Uehara over the wall in right center and into the giant fish tank for a 5 4 Rays' win.The Red Sox lead the best of five series, 2 1, with Game 4 here on Tuesday night .\"It was down, but he got the head of the bat on it and the rest is Rays history,\" said Tampa Bay Manager Joe Maddon, whose team was back home after a 12 day, 5 city trip that included three win or go home games to reach the division series . \"It's really an incredible game to participate in.\"It was the first home run Uehara has allowed since June, a stretch of 37 appearances and 401 3 innings in which he allowed only one earned run. He had become so efficient that his teammates described him as automatic, a weapon to unleash.Lobaton was less of an automatic in the Rays' lineup, having split time with Jose Molina at catcher. He had only nine career home runs, and he was a late replacement in the game, coming in to catch after Molina had been pinch hit for in the bottom of the eighth. With one at bat, one swing, though, he had enough to beat Uehara and the Red Sox .\"We knew coming in this was going to be a hard fought series,\" Boston Manager John Farrell said. \"They played well tonight. We left a number of guys on base, as did they. But we'll be ready to go tomorrow night, for sure.\" Boston looked poised to close out this series from the get go. The Red Sox had Clay Buchholz on the mound. He had started the season on a tear, posting a 9 0 record and a.71 earned run average to earn an All Star nod. But then he spent about three months on the disabled list with a strained bursa sac in his right shoulder. He was just as dominant when he returned. In four September starts, he went 3 1 with a.88 E.R.A. Rays starter Alex Cobb, in his first full season in the majors, had also been impressive. But he had also missed significant time, about two months, after sustaining a concussion when he was hit in the head by a line drive. He finished the regular season with an 11 3 record and a.76 E.R.A. in 22 starts, and pitched six and two thirds scoreless innings last week to defeat Cleveland in the A.L. wild card game, another must win game after the Rays won a tiebreaker against the Texas Rangers to secure the league's second wild card . Boston went right to work, though, manufacturing a run in the first inning. Jacoby Ellsbury led off with a single through the left side, and Shane Victorino was hit by a pitch on his upper arm. Dustin Pedroia then hit what appeared to be a sure double play grounder to third, but Victorino slid hard into second, and Ben Zobrist made a wild throw to first. Ellsbury trotted home to give Boston a 1 0 lead. Ellsbury, in particular, would torment Cobb, who made it through the next three innings unscathed by effectively mixing his fastballs, curves and changeups, until Ellsbury doubled off him in the fifth.Victorino then hit a chopper to the right of the shortstop, Yunel Escobar, and Ellsbury beat Escobar's throw to third. Both runners would score Ellsbury on a wild pitch, and Victorino, two batters later, on a single by David Ortiz to push the lead to.Buchholz had limited the Rays to this point, escaping a two out, bases loaded jam by striking out Matt Joyce to end the fourth. He faced another predicament in the fifth when the Rays had two on with two outs and Evan Longoria at the plate. Buchholz tried his changeup, and Longoria smacked it over the left field wall to tie the score at.The game was deadlocked until the eighth Cobb and Buchholz both gone when the Rays strung together a series of clutch at bats. James Loney drew a leadoff walk, Desmond Jennings reached safely on a bunt single, and two batters later, Escobar reached on an infield single . Delmon Young then hit a sharp grounder to Mike Napoli at first base, and Sam Fuld, who had run for Loney, sprinted home. Napoli, clearly annoyed, turned and touched first base.But the Red Sox responded in the ninth. Will Middlebrooks drew a walk, Ellsbury singled and Victorino advanced them both on a sacrifice bunt . A groundout by Pedroia then scored Xander Bogaerts, who ran for Middlebrooks, to tie the game at.That set the stage for Lobaton.The Rays won without much help from Wil Myers, who batted cleanup. Maddon said that he thought Myers would rebound after his costly mistake and subsequent hazing over the weekend in Boston . But Myers went 0 for, with a walk, and fell to 0 for 12 in this series. Maddon pulled him in the seventh after he struck out with the go ahead run on second to end the inning . Maddon said that Myers had cramps in his legs.Plenty of others stepped in in Myers's place, but in the end none bigger than Lobaton, who allowed the Rays to play another day."}

{"_id": 24, "text": "SAN DIEGO One minute, John Buck was putting on his workout clothes, getting ready to play catcher in the Mets ' game against the San Diego Padres on Friday night . The next, he was packing his bags and getting ready to fly back to New York, where his wife was preparing to give birth.Buck's three day paternity leave will start officially on Saturday, meaning that Travis d'Arnaud, one of baseball's top catching prospects, will make his long awaited debut for the Mets . D'Arnaud, who was playing for the organization's Class AAA affiliate in Las Vegas, headed to San Diego late Friday and was expected to start behind the plate Saturday afternoon .\"It will be nice to see him in a New York Mets uniform,\" General Manager Sandy Alderson said.D'Arnaud was the centerpiece of a package of players the Mets received from the Toronto Blue Jays last winter when they traded R. A. Dickey, last season's National League Cy Young Award winner . But d'Arnaud's season was derailed early on when he fouled a ball off his foot and fractured a metatarsal, an injury that forced him to miss several weeks. The injury, Alderson said, mixed some disappointment into the excitement that built as soon as d'Arnaud joined the organization.\"From his standpoint as well as ours, there's a lot of anticipation,\" Alderson said.The Mets have been prepared to promote d'Arnaud for the last two weeks, after Buck announced his wife was due to give birth on Aug. 1. D'Arnaud was moved to Las Vegas, partly to be close to the Mets during their West Coast trip, and he got valuable playing time there as the days passed and Buck remained with the team.Over all, d'Arnaud has made 78 plate appearances at Class AAA this year, compiling a.304 batting average, a.487 on base percentage and a.554 slugging percentage .\"He's done very well there,\" Alderson said. \"His approach, offensively, has been terrific. He's throwing the ball well. We'll see what he offers. At the end of three days, we'll see where we are.\" Alderson did not rule out the possibility that d'Arnaud would stay on the roster after Buck returned. But he noted, too, that d'Arnaud would join the club no matter what as a September call up.WHEELER'S WINDUP Zack Wheeler's recent performance boost has coincided with a minor but noticeable change in the speed, rhythm and fluidity of his pitching motion.\"Before, I would go, stop, go up, stop, and then try to go,\" Wheeler said, pantomiming a staccato windup inside the Mets' clubhouse Friday afternoon . \"I didn't know I was doing it. I've got a good rhythm now, where everything flows.\"Wheeler and Dan Warthen, the club's pitching coach, worked the last few weeks on focusing on a few keys to hone more repeatable mechanics. Wheeler has taken to them. His motion is smoother now, and the components combine more quickly toward the plate. Since the start of July, he is 4 1 with a.87 earned run average . Over his last two outings, he has issued just one walk.\"The delivery has gotten to the point now where it's one piece, and he's executing pitches better than he has, maybe better than any time in his life,\" Warthen said. \"I know he's been frustrated with me at times because I kept getting on him and getting on him 'You've got to repeat. You've got to repeat.' \"Warthen added, \"The last three weeks, especially, any little adjustment we've asked him to make boom, boom, boom he's made them.\"Warthen said Wheeler's secondary pitches were hitting their targets much more often than when he was called up in June, adding a tough complement to his lively fastball. John Buck said \"He could throw a complete game just throwing fastballs, and he'd still make hitters feel uneasy. The movement, what it does, how hard it is, how funky he is, how close to the plate he is when he delivers it's not easy for the hitter.\"Warthen said Wheeler's anxiety and adrenaline resulting from his rise to the big leagues had apparently subsided, too. And still, Warthen said he did not believe that he had seen Wheeler at his \"100 percent ability.\"\"He's not hurting by any means, but he's probably a little fatigued at this point in the year,\" Warthen said. \"We may see an even more electric fastball next year.\"PRIME TIME METS The Mets Nationals game in Washington on Sept. 1 will have an 05 p.m. start time to be broadcast as ESPN's prime time game. The Mets have long been scheduled to play at 10 p.m. the next day against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field .\"Can that be reviewed?\" Manager Terry Collins said upon hearing the news, making a joking reference to baseball's plan to add instant replay reviews to games next season."}
{"_id": 24, "text": "PHOENIX Maybe this is just what Mets first baseman Ike Davis needed a return to his roots, a place where words like \"arbitration\" and \"expectation\" never polluted the dry desert air.Davis is at a pivotal place in his career. A nearly one month stint at Class AAA Las Vegas hinted at an organization that is pondering whether he has a role in its future. A strong offensive outing Saturday night against the Arizona Diamondbacks suggested a player who will not go down without a fight.Davis, who played high school and college baseball within 30 miles of Chase Field, went 2 for 2 with two walks, one intentional, in a 4 1 victory over the Diamondbacks . Most significant, he showed the patience at the plate that had eluded him before he was sent down June 9 because of a.161 average and 66 strikeouts.First, he walked on four straight pitches. Then he lined a full count double into deep center. His third at bat produced a hard hit single to right. When he stepped to the plate for the fourth time, the Diamondbacks intentionally walked him.He has heated up in August, batting .500 (9 of 18) with 11 walks. In the visitors' clubhouse before the game, Davis played a hockey video game with teammates and seemed at peace with how his season had unfolded.\"It's tough to struggle in front of everybody,\" he said, \"but there's not a lot of people that haven't struggled in this game. As long as I continue to improve on what I'm working on and keep it going, it's not all for waste.\"That is a mentality he learned from his father, Ron, an 11 year major league pitcher who was traded three times and spent a chunk of his career under the microscope of Yankees fans.\"It's just part of the game,\" said Ron Davis, who was at Chase Field on Saturday night . \"That's the main thing, and he knows that. Things happen to baseball players.\"I went to arbitration twice. One side will say all kinds of great things. The other makes you wonder how you even played Little League .\"In January, Ike Davis avoided an arbitration showdown with the Mets by agreeing to a one year contract worth more than 3 million . Where the Mets go from here hinges on whether they believe Davis is the player they saw early in his career, the one who set and tied Mets rookie records and attracted \"I Like Ike\" signs at Citi Field, or the one who endured big slumps in the 2012 and 2013 seasons and drew the ire of fans who no longer had patience for him.\"It's the nature of the game,\" he said. \"It's a tough game, and if you're not point on, you're going to struggle.\"This game marked the first time this season Davis's average surpassed.200.He clearly has a fondness for this park. It was here in 2012 that he blasted three home runs in one game off pitcher Ian Kennedy . Mets Manager Terry Collins said he still believed Davis commanded respect at the plate.\"I think a lot of times he's still dangerous in a lot of people's eyes even though his numbers don't relate to that,\" Collins said. \"He gets in the batter's box, and the other pitching coach and the other pitcher know he's the one guy who can do damage. In my estimation, I think they're being very careful with him.\"David Hernandez's intentional walk of Davis in the eighth confirmed that. Consider it a nod to the work Davis put in while in Las Vegas .The priority, he said, was \"calming\" his swing and not having so much movement during the process. It is a mechanical adjustment that is triggered by mental preparation. The result? A.293 average with 7 home runs and 13 R.B.I. in 75 at bats in Las Vegas . He also had 17 walks, which impressed Collins .\"Now he's being a lot more patient than he was before he went down,\" Collins said, \"and that's led to him getting some base on balls.\"Ron Davis said \" The main thing he changed was not swinging for the ball out of the zone. When you want it so bad, you start swinging out of the zone then pitchers start throwing out of the zone.\"It will take more than one strong offensive game to persuade the Mets to commit to a future with Davis. The organization is clearly sitting back and taking note."}
{"_id": 24, "text": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. As baseball's annual winter meetings kicked into gear Monday, the Mets were busy working on complementary deals that would fill out their roster. Sandy Alderson, the no longer impoverished general manager, had three or four more needs to address, some trade chips available and roughly 10 million to 12 million to spend. He said that he had been so busy that he missed Sunday night's episode of \"Homeland.\"\"So don't say anything, O.K.?\" he added.He was more serious discussing, in vague terms, what he might do next. He had already accomplished a good deal, adding the free agent outfielders Chris Young and Curtis Granderson at a likely cost of 23 million on the 2014 payroll . His No. 1 need seems to be finding a veteran starting pitcher who is not very expensive and could help fill out a rotation that has Zack Wheeler, Dillon Gee and Jon Niese but will be without Matt Harvey until. Alderson said he would be hesitant to give a free agent starting pitcher a multiyear deal, only because he expected his two top pitching prospects, Noah Syndergaard and Rafael Montero, to be ready to join the major league rotation sooner rather than later. He said he would prefer not to bring either up until midseason, following the formula he followed with Harvey in 2012 and Wheeler in, but indicated he might not have the luxury to be that patient.\"Ideally, we'd like to ease guys in,\" Alderson said. \"But these may not be ideal times.\"Another option for the rotation is Jenrry Mejia, who Alderson said will compete for a spot in spring training . Mejia has been an elusive prospect for the Mets because of a series of arm injuries, one of which required Tommy John elbow surgery .Indeed, Alderson said he wondered if Mejia could stay healthy for a sustained period. Last season, Mejia joined the rotation in the second half and pitched effectively in five starts, with a.70 earned run average, but then was shut down to have surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He is still only.In addition, Alderson has met with a representative for Bartolo Colon, who is 16 years older than Mejia. But Colon, almost defying logic, went 18 6 for Oakland in, with a.65 E.R.A. in 30 starts. He may be looking for more money than the Mets want to pay him.Another potential candidate, Bronson Arroyo, has proved to be remarkably durable for Cincinnati during the past eight seasons. But at, he is seeking a multiyear deal perhaps worth close to 10 million a year, which is also probably too rich for the Mets, even if they did just give Granderson 60 million over four years.It might make the most sense for Alderson to take a flier on a pitcher such as Daisuke Matsuzaka or Johan Santana . Matsuzaka allowed just four runs in his final four starts for the Mets last season after being acquired almost as an afterthought. However, Alderson said, there have been no discussions aimed at bringing back Matsuzaka. Santana, battered by injuries, has not pitched in two of the past three seasons and is finally off the Mets' payroll . But would Alderson bring him back at an extremely reduced rate?Wait and see, Alderson said. Until that time, there's that episode of \"Homeland\" he would like to take a peek at."}
{"_id": 24, "text": "Matt Harvey's persistent dominance this year may have lulled some fans and observers into idle expectancy, a mental state in which a merely serviceable outing from the young ace, like the one he offered Wednesday night, feels oddly jarring.Even when the Mets were struggling earlier this year, losing games at an alarming rate, Harvey was their every five days salve. And yet here he was on a muggy night at Citi Field, struggling to keep alive his team's newfound midsummer momentum.Pitching before a sellout crowd only the second one this year for the Mets Harvey allowed five runs, tying a career high, over six plus uneven innings. His struggles were relative, considering he notched nine strikeouts, and at times he appeared overpowering, as he generally does. But for once he was inadequate, as the Mets fell, 5 3, to the Arizona Diamondbacks .\"He just didn't have command of his stuff you know, a lot of deep counts,\" Manager Terry Collins said. \"We've seen him pitch a lot better, that's for sure.\"The Mets, who began the day 11 6 over the previous 17 games, fell to 35 46 over all and will play one more game at home before embarking on a three city trip to close out their first half. Harvey threw his first pitch at 01 p.m. after rain delayed the start by 1 hour 51 minutes inside a packed stadium. The Mets, on the night before the Fourth of July, were promising a postgame fireworks display, and there was a festive mood around the park, where chants were spreading quickly across noisy stands. During one between innings scoreboard interlude, Mrs. Met, a female counterpart for the team's longtime mascot, was reintroduced after nearly a decade away, to much applause.But the most compelling draw was on the mound.Less than a year into Harvey's big league career, his excellence has become taken for granted. The question before any start now seems to be whether he might pitch a no hitter. On three occasions this year, he put together no hit bids that exceeded six innings, and last Friday, he retired the first 14 Washington Nationals batters he faced .But the intrigue was punctured quickly. After recording one fast out, Harvey allowed two quick singles and then issued a walk to load the bases . This prompted David Wright to jog toward the mound to deliver a quick, encouraging word, and Harvey induced a double play to end the inning . Collins said he did not know whether the delay harmed Harvey, but he knew it did not help him.\"You've just got to block it out and try to do everything normal,\" Harvey said of the delay. \"I prepared for 7 o'clock. I'm not one to make an excuse. I should have been more prepared. I obviously didn't do a good job of that.\"After that hiccup, it seemed Harvey was bouncing back. He appeared to find a short groove, striking out a chain of batters, riling up the crowd. The 92 miles per hour slider he used to slip away from a minor fifth inning jam seemed unhittable.And as he stabilized somewhat, the Mets provided him a lead on a fourth inning power surge against Randall Delgado, the Diamondbacks' starter. Wright slammed his 13th home run his first since June 23 into the left field stands, crouching ever so slightly as he slashed at a 3 2 changeup near his kneecaps.One out later, first baseman Josh Satin battled through a nine pitch at bat before whipping a full count inside fastball just inside the left field foul pole . Satin, a minor revelation for the Mets since the team sent Ike Davis to the minor leagues earlier this month, increased his hitting streak to nine games and his on base streak to.\"That was really the last thing left that I hadn't done,\" Satin said of his homer. \"It was great feeling.\"But the ballpark grew hushed the buzz felt extinguished during the sixth, when Cody Ross belted a hanging slider from Harvey over the left field wall for a three run homer . Suddenly, the Mets were behind, 3 2. It was only the sixth home run Harvey has allowed this year and, just like that, he was positioned for just his second loss this year. Harvey could not gather himself after that. He came out for the seventh, but allowed a walk, a single, and a double off the left field wall . Through that sequence, the Diamondbacks increased their lead to 4 2 and sent Collins to the mound to fetch his ace . The Diamondbacks added another run, charged to Harvey, on a sacrifice fly .\"Pretty much all night, I wasn't making good pitches,\" Harvey said. \"I wasn't hitting my spots too well. The ball was up a little bit, and they took full advantage of that.\" Harvey allowed nine hits over all and walked three batters. His earned run average crept up to.27, while his record fell to. Once he was pulled, the Mets inched back, getting an eighth inning solo home run from Daniel Murphy .But it was not enough to salvage a night when their ace a player for whom brilliance has felt commonplace pitched below his own lofty standard. Shaun Marcum this week experienced a recurrence of the shoulder and neck tightness that plagued him during spring training and forced him to the disabled list at the start of the season, Terry Collins said. After throwing 101 pitches over six innings on Monday night, Marcum informed coaches about the discomfort. On Tuesday he was sent for a magnetic resonance imaging exam, which showed no structural damage . Collins said Marcum would still make his next scheduled start Saturday night against the Milwaukee Brewers ."}
